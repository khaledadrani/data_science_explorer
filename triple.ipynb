The COVID-19 pandemic’s\\\\nimpact  accelerated  through  the  first  half  of  2020,\\\\nculminating  in  a  significant  number  of  temporary  store\\\\nclosures  across  many  of  our  markets  worldwide.  Our\\\\nbusiness continuity plans and our operational excellence\\\\nenabled  us  to  limit  the  effects  of  the  pandemic  and\\\\ncontinue  to  meet  the  critical  needs  of  our  customers.\\\\nWhile addressing the severe challenges of the pandemic,\\\\nwe were able to continue the execution of our long-term\\\\nstrategy.\\\\n\\\\nAs  soon  as  the  potential  impact  of  the  COVID-19\\\\npandemic became apparent in our territories, we focused\\\\non  our  people,  customers,  stakeholders  and \\\\nthe\\\\nCompany\\\\\\'s financial health. Based on this approach, we\\\\nthree  priorities:  Care,  Cash,  and\\\\noperated  under \\\\nContinuity. Concretely, this means:\\\\n\\\\n• Care: We gave our highest priority to ensure the safety\\\\nand  welfare  of  our  staff  and  customers.  Everywhere\\\\nthat  we  were  able  to  continue  store  operations,  we\\\\nrapidly implemented hygiene and safety protocols and\\\\nequipped  stores  with  distance  separations  and\\\\nprotective equipment, such as face masks and hygiene\\\\ngels. \\\\nIn  addition,  we  accelerated  necessary\\\\ninvestments in customer-facing tools such as optical e-\\\\ncommerce  functionality  to  enable  our  customers  to\\\\ninteract  even  better  with  our  local  online  and  offline\\\\nretail brands.\\\\n\\\\n• Cash: We focused on preserving liquidity by setting up\\\\na  central  Task  Force  to  monitor  our  rolling  liquidity\\\\nincluding  scenario  planning.  We  also\\\\nforecast \\\\nsuccessfully  renegotiated  existing  and  new  credit\\\\nfacilities with our relationship banks.\\\\n\\\\n8\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nS\\\\nA\\\\nG\\\\nE\\\\nF\\\\nR\\\\nO\\\\nM\\\\nO\\\\nU\\\\nR\\\\nC\\\\nE\\\\nO\\\\n\\\\n• Continuity:  We  focused  on  balancing  continued  cost\\\\nin\\\\ndiscipline  and  cash  preservation, \\\\nimportant strategic initiatives and close collaboration\\\\nwith our business partners; all within a framework of\\\\nconstantly \\\\nand  market\\\\ndevelopments.\\\\n\\\\ninvestments \\\\n\\\\nscenarios \\\\n\\\\nchanging \\\\n\\\\nDespite  significant  disruptions,  our  employees  have\\\\ndemonstrated extraordinary determination to adjust and\\\\nadapt  to  the  evolving  landscape.  I  am  proud  of  their\\\\nresilience, engagement and relentless focus in the face of\\\\npersonal and professional challenges. I am also grateful\\\\nto our business partners, for their efforts in enabling us to\\\\nkeep the operations running where possible, and to serve\\\\nour customers in a safe and sustainable manner during\\\\nthese difficult times.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness performance\\\\nIn \\\\nchallenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\\\n\\\\nfinancial  year  2020,  we \\\\n\\\\nthe \\\\n\\\\nfaced  significant\\\\n\\\\nOur performance varied significantly through the months\\\\nafter the outbreak in March, with a strong recovery in 3Q\\\\nas  restrictions  were  lifted.  By  rapidly  adapting  to  the\\\\nchanged environment, we managed to partially mitigate\\\\nthe  dramatic  decline  in  customer  traffic  through  higher\\\\nconversion \\\\nactivities.\\\\nintensified \\\\nUnfortunately, towards the end of the year, the impact of\\\\nthe second wave of the COVID-19 resulted in a slowdown\\\\nof our strong recovery in the second half of the year.\\\\n\\\\nonline \\\\n\\\\nand \\\\n\\\\nOur  revenue  at  constant  exchange  rates  declined  by\\\\n13.8% for the full year with an organic and comparable\\\\ndecrease of 13.6% and 14.1%, respectively.\\\\n\\\\nAdjusted  EBITA  was  EUR  266  million  for  2020,  a\\\\nsignificant reduction in profitability caused mainly due to\\\\nthe  loss  of  revenue,  negatively  impacting  operating\\\\nleverage  in  the  spring  and  summer.  Our  business\\\\ncontinuity  plans  and  ability  to  adapt  quickly  to  the\\\\nchanged  market  conditions  caused  by  the  COVID-19\\\\npandemic  enabled  us  to  limit  the  impact  of  these\\\\ndisruptions  and  continue  to  pursue  key  strategic\\\\nobjectives.\\\\n\\\\nCritically,  the  resilience  of  our  business,  paired  with\\\\nin  all  our  Operating\\\\ncontinued  financial  discipline \\\\nCompanies  resulted  in  our  strong  financial  position  at\\\\nyear  end.

I  am  proud  that  we  recorded  another\\\\nincrease in our group-wide net promoter score from 65 in\\\\n2019,  to  70  this  year.  And  I  do  not  want  to  miss  the\\\\nopportunity  to  thank  all  our  customers  worldwide  for\\\\ntheir  ongoing  loyalty  and  trust  in  our  eyecare  products\\\\nand services.\\\\n\\\\nThis  strongly  confirms  that  our  relentless  efforts  to\\\\nimprove  our  value  proposition  have  been  positively\\\\nreceived  by  our  customers.  The  ongoing  operational\\\\nexcellence  of  our  staff  in  each  of  our  7,260  stores\\\\nworldwide  as  well  as  in  all  support  offices  was  a  core\\\\ndriver. In addition, we made good progress implementing\\\\nour strategic agenda, which we shared during the Capital\\\\nMarket  Day  at  the  end  of  2018.

We  also  made  good  progress \\\\nin\\\\nsubscription-based sales in both the optical and contact\\\\nlens categories.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, our Customer 360 platform, which provides\\\\nholistic  marketing  and  CRM  solutions  and  enables\\\\npersonalized  digital  advertising  activities,  has  been\\\\nexpanded  to  10  markets,  including  Denmark,  Sweden,\\\\nand the U.S.\\\\n\\\\nAll of this has not only supported an evident acceleration\\\\nof a shift in customer behavior in 2020, but also led to an\\\\n85%  increase  in  retail  brand  related  e-commerce  sales\\\\nand  a  significant  increase  of  digitally-influenced  store\\\\nsales.\\\\n\\\\nIn  2021  we  continue,  and  accelerate,  to  provide  all\\\\nOperating  Companies  with \\\\nrelevant  omnichannel\\\\ntechnology  and  capabilities  to  offer  our  customers  the\\\\nmost  convenient  360  degree  access  to  our  eyecare\\\\nproducts and services.\\\\n\\\\nProduct Value Chain transformation\\\\nThe second pillar of our strategic plan is the end-to-end\\\\nProduct  Value  Chain  transformation.  This  initiative,\\\\nlaunched in 2018, has two main objectives. It enables a\\\\nfull and effective omnichannel business and it also drives\\\\nfurther  business  efficiency  through  standardization,\\\\nautomation and global economies of scale.\\\\n\\\\nI am glad to report that we made very good progress in\\\\nthis  field.  We  streamlined  our  product  assortment  to  a\\\\nglobally unified offer, completed a global product master\\\\ndata repository and started our first eco-friendly product\\\\nline  with  DbyD.  In  addition,  our  first  real  Regional\\\\nFulfilment Hub (RFH) in Porto, Portugal, now serves five\\\\ncountries  in  northern  and  southern  Europe,  with  fully\\\\nintegrated processes from customer store orders to lens\\\\ncutting  and  full  mounting.  In  2020,  this  RFH  began  to\\\\nprocess  online  customer  orders  to  deliver  a  full\\\\nomnichannel customer experience.\\\\n\\\\nThe Porto RFH set-up serves as a blueprint for all other\\\\nRFHs, which we will transform in the upcoming years. We\\\\nexpect \\\\nthis  standardized  and  centralized  network\\\\nstructure  to  yield  significant  benefits.  These  include\\\\nimproved  customer  experience,  better  lead  times  and\\\\nproduct  availability,  and  significant  efficiency  gains  in\\\\noperating costs and working capital.\\\\n\\\\nNew store concept\\\\nIn  2020  we  piloted  an  updated  store  concept  in  several\\\\nmarkets with a strong focus on improving the customer\\\\nexperience  and  further  integrating  our  omnichannel-\\\\nfocused  customer  journey.  The  results  were  promising\\\\nand  we  have  started  to  roll  the  concept  out  in  The\\\\nNetherlands,  U.K.,  France,  Switzerland,  and  Germany\\\\nwith a plan to begin the global roll-out in 2021.\\\\n\\\\nSustainability focus\\\\nWe  remain  highly-committed  to  establishing  Corporate\\\\nResponsibility  and  Sustainability  (CSR)  as  a  shared\\\\n\\\\n9\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nS\\\\nA\\\\nG\\\\nE\\\\nF\\\\nR\\\\nO\\\\nM\\\\nO\\\\nU\\\\nR\\\\nC\\\\nE\\\\nO\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cmindset  across  GrandVision.  It  is  our  ambition  to\\\\nintegrate it further into our business model to continue to\\\\nimprove  the  quality  of  life  of  more  people  through\\\\naffordable  or  free  eyecare  and  sustainable  business\\\\npractices.  To  achieve  this,  we  align  our  global  CSR\\\\napproach with GrandVision’s culture and values, as well\\\\nas with global sustainability trends and agendas. Notably,\\\\nthis  includes  the  UN  Global  Sustainable  Development\\\\nGoals.\\\\n\\\\nIn  2020,  our  main  focus  was  to  further  onboard  all\\\\nGrandVision Operating Companies to our CSR roadmap\\\\nand  environmental,  social  and  governance \\\\n(ESG)\\\\npriorities,  thus  increasing  our  global  contribution  to\\\\nmajor  societal  issues.  These  include  gender  equality,\\\\nfairness  and  transparency  in  supply  chains,  climate\\\\nchange, contributions to local communities, and support\\\\nfor underprivileged populations by increasing awareness\\\\nand  education  about  eye  health,  as  well  as  donating\\\\neyewear and eyecare.\\\\n\\\\nI am proud to share that our ESG rankings, most notably\\\\nfrom  Sustainalytics  and  the  Carbon  Disclosure  Project,\\\\nreflect the strong progress we have made. We achieved\\\\nan  improvement  of  five  points  in  our  Sustainalytics\\\\nranking,  which \\\\nled  to  financial  savings  from  our\\\\nSustainability Linked Loan and Revolving Credit Facility.\\\\nWe  maintained  our  Carbon  Disclosure  Project  score  of\\\\n\\\\\\'B,\\\\\\' on a scale of \\\\\\'A\\\\\\' to \\\\\\'F,\\\\\\' which is higher than the Europe\\\\nregional average of \\\\\\'C.\\\\\\' And we improved our position in\\\\nthe  Tax  Transparency  Benchmark  to  the  top  10%  of\\\\nparticipating companies in The Netherlands and we are\\\\nrecognized as a \\\\\\'Top Scorer.\\\\\\'\\\\n\\\\nTo  conclude,  I  am  proud  of  the  determination  and\\\\ntogetherness  that  our  employees  demonstrated  across\\\\nthe  organization  during  this  very  exceptional  year  and  I\\\\nfeel  truly  privileged  to  work  with  such  committed\\\\ncolleagues.

Unfortunately, it affected our business\\\\nin  many  ways.  Stay-at-home  orders  protected  peoples’\\\\nhealth  to  the  best  of  governments’  abilities  but  created  a\\\\ncomplicated  situation  for  store  retailers.  This  is  why  we  all\\\\nhad to quickly adapt to a \\\\\\'new normal.\\\\\\'\\\\n\\\\nCreating a responsive Task Force\\\\nSince  the  pandemic  hit  Europe,  GrandVision  strengthened\\\\nits  financial  discipline  to  keep  our  business  running  while\\\\nfocusing  on  customer  and  employee  safety.  We  created  a\\\\ncross-functional,  in-house  expert  Task  Force  to  develop  a\\\\ncohesive plan to continue safely running our global optical\\\\nretail business with great success during a challenging time.\\\\nThis team operated under the following priorities:\\\\n\\\\n• Care: Protection of our staff and customers\\\\n• Cash:  Preservation  of  the  liquidity  situation  for  the\\\\n\\\\nCompany\\\\n\\\\n• Continuity:  Continued  balance  between  cost  discipline\\\\nand  cash  preservation  with  investments  in  important\\\\nstrategic initiatives\\\\n\\\\nGuided  by  these  priorities,  we  focused  on  our  people,\\\\ncustomers, stakeholders and the Company\\\\\\'s financial health.\\\\nOur  thorough  scenario-planning  and  establishment  of  a\\\\ncentral  Task  Force  to  ensure  clarity  of  communication  and\\\\nfast response time were vital drivers of this success.\\\\n\\\\nAdapting to new consumer behaviors\\\\nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  impacted  consumer  behavior  for\\\\nthe optical retail industry and other industries, too.\\\\n\\\\nAnd  thanks  to  continued  investment  in  our  established\\\\nomnichannel strategy, including a focus on e-commerce and\\\\ninnovations like our advanced appointment booking tool, we\\\\noffered our customers the possibility to still engage with us,\\\\nonline  and  instore.  They  were  able  to  purchase  the  same\\\\nproducts they know and love from our websites instead of in\\\\nour stores. They have also been able to conveniently access\\\\ninformation about eyecare, see which local stores were open\\\\nfor eye exams and make appointments to safely visit stores.\\\\n\\\\nTo  illustrate  our  performance,  in  2020,  we  saw  an  85%\\\\nincrease in retail brand related e-commerce sales. We also\\\\nrealized higher customer conversion in our stores and more\\\\nevenly-distributed  traffic  flow  throughout  the  week,  which\\\\n\\\\nwas partly driven by increased online appointment bookings.\\\\nIn turn, these led to an increase in store productivity.\\\\n\\\\nOpened for essential and emergency care\\\\nAlthough  government  regulations  across  Europe,  South\\\\nAmerica  and  North  America  led  to  many  temporary  store\\\\nclosures  from  March  to  June  2020,  opticians  and  optical\\\\nretailers \\\\nin  some  markets  were  considered  essential\\\\nhealthcare providers.\\\\n\\\\nWhere  we  were  able  to  operate  our  stores  safely,  we\\\\noutfitted  them  with  COVID-19-specific  safety  measures  to\\\\nreduce  person-to-person  contact  as  well  as  personal\\\\nprotective equipment (PPE) to protect store employees and\\\\ncustomers.  Customers  could  only  visit  these  stores  by\\\\nappointment,  which  they  booked  using  our  omnichannel\\\\nplatform.  In  total,  we  were  able  to  keep  about  40%  of  our\\\\nstores partially open during peak lockdown status.\\\\n\\\\nBy late autumn, the first signs of European markets affected\\\\nby the second wave of COVID-19 appeared as governments\\\\nre-introduced stricter measures to contain the spread of the\\\\nvirus.  We  had  gained  valuable  experience  during  the  first\\\\nwave and used the developed best practices to safely keep\\\\nour  stores  open  and  maintain  a  strong  2020  performance\\\\nduring the second wave.\\\\n\\\\nEnsured our employees and customers safety and well-\\\\nbeing during a global pandemic\\\\nThroughout  2020,  our  store  employees  felt  safe  thanks  to\\\\nthe  careful  measures  we  put  in  place  to  protect  them.  We\\\\nestablished  clear  safety  measures,  delivered  PPEs  to  our\\\\nstores  for  employees  and  customers,  and  adjusted  the\\\\ninstore eye exam process for employees and customers with\\\\na smooth and safe experience.\\\\n\\\\n13\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nF\\\\nO\\\\nC\\\\nU\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\nWe are proud to report that our latest GrandVision employee\\\\nNPS  survey  scores  have  increased,  which  validates  the\\\\npositive  employee  satisfaction \\\\nface  of  such\\\\nchallenging factors.\\\\n\\\\nthe \\\\n\\\\nin \\\\n\\\\nIn 2020, despite the global pandemic, we not only kept our\\\\nGrandVision  employees  and  customers  safe,  we  also  won\\\\nmany  employer  and  retailer  awards  within  GrandVision,\\\\nincluding  \\\\\\'Retailer  of  the  Year,\\\\\\'  \\\\\\'Great  Place  to  Work,\\\\\\'  and\\\\n\\\\\\'Best  Customer  Service.\\\\\\'  (See  Section  3.1 \\\\n\\\\\\'Our  many\\\\ncustomer  touchpoints\\\\\\'  for  more  information  about  our\\\\nawards.)\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cCHAPTER\\\\n\\\\nBusiness and\\\\nstrategy\\\\n\\\\n\\\\x0cThe environment in which we operate\\\\n\\\\nGrandVision is a global optical retail leader active in more\\\\nthan 40 countries across multiple continents.

In  order  to  position\\\\nGrandVision  and  our  retail  brands  as  eyecare  experts,  we\\\\nestablished  the  GrandVision  Eye  Care  Council  (GVEC)  in\\\\n2019.  This  cross-functional  network  brings  an  array  of\\\\neyecare-related expertise from across the business, ensures\\\\nwe secure a broad scope of information and takes a diverse\\\\napproach to leading in a global eyecare agenda. The GVEC\\\\nalso  serves  as  a  scout  for  innovation  and  a  first  point  of\\\\ncontact for relevant eyecare-related external parties.\\\\n\\\\nThe GVEC works with the following six strategic pillars:\\\\n\\\\n• People: Establish GrandVision as the preferred employer\\\\n\\\\nin the optical retail market.\\\\n\\\\n• Communication:  Empower  our  retail  brands  to  become\\\\n\\\\nlocal leaders in eyecare communication.\\\\n\\\\n• Products:  Provide  innovative  and  customer-relevant\\\\n\\\\nproduct offers.\\\\n\\\\n• Technology  and  innovation:  Explore  and  be  on  the\\\\n\\\\nforefront of eyecare developments.\\\\n\\\\n• External relations: Expand our presence and visibility in\\\\n\\\\nrelevant eyecare markets.\\\\n\\\\n• Eyecare  services  and  development:  Ensure  quality\\\\nservice  and  continuous  improvements  in  collaboration\\\\nwith suppliers.\\\\n\\\\nBuilding  on  the  widely-recognized  Euromonitor  consumer\\\\nmegatrend  survey,  the  GVEC  has  identified  five  consumer\\\\ninfluence  how  our\\\\nmegatrends  that  we  believe  will \\\\ncustomers think and act in the years to come. Next to the six\\\\nstrategic  pillars  above,  these  megatrends  closely  guide  our\\\\nCouncil’s work. The identified consumer megatrends are to:\\\\n\\\\n1. Save time: Seek convenience that enhances the customer\\\\n\\\\nexperience.\\\\n\\\\n2. Save  money:  Smart  customer  behavior  is  on  the  rise.\\\\nSave  where  you  can  and  spend  more  money  where  you\\\\nprioritize it.\\\\n\\\\n3.

Let me be me: Personalization and individualization are\\\\n\\\\non the rise.\\\\n\\\\nExploring pilots and projects\\\\nIn  2020,  the  GVEC  supported  several  innovative  pilots  and\\\\nprojects.  In  the  U.S.,  we  established  teleoptometry  as  a\\\\nservice  in  13  stores,  and  this  has  also  been  piloted  in  our\\\\nPolish  and  Swedish  stores.  We  are  exploring  artificial\\\\nintelligence  opportunities  related  to  fundus  imagery  in\\\\nPoland  and  Spain,  and  we  have  introduced  an  online  eye\\\\ntest  pilot  through  our  Finnish  and  Polish  retail  brands’  e-\\\\ncommerce platforms.\\\\n\\\\nWe believe that both consumer demand, as described in the\\\\nfive  megatrends  we  shared  above,  as  well  as  technological\\\\ndevelopments and innovation will drive the need for change\\\\nin  the  eyecare  field  in  the  future.  The  GVEC  plays  an\\\\ninstrumental role in prioritizing and creating momentum for\\\\nthis to happen.\\\\n\\\\nServing as a knowledge resource\\\\nThe  GVEC  has  established  a  centralized  repository  of\\\\neyecare-related  information  and  content  for  all  our  retail\\\\nbrands to use. This includes a variety of content formats like\\\\ntext,  original  photography  and  videos  for  all  of  our\\\\ncommunication channels.\\\\n\\\\nTo  keep  its  eyecare  expertise  sharp,  the  GVEC  meets\\\\nregularly to share the latest eyecare updates and news, and\\\\nalso  to  share  updates  on  pilots  and  projects.  Best  practice\\\\ninitiatives are shared globally through the GrandVision-wide\\\\neyecare community, either in regular global webinars or on\\\\nthe  global  community  platform.  These  include  eyecare-\\\\nrelated  topics  like  diagnosing  eye  conditions  and  eye\\\\ncondition  management,  new  eyecare  technology  and\\\\nsuccessful retail brand campaigns.\\\\n\\\\nOne  of  our  success  stories  comes  from  Vision  Express\\\\nPoland.  The  retail  brand  conducted  research  that  revealed\\\\n50% of Polish children have never had an eye examination,\\\\nand  79%  of  parents  claim  that  vision  problems  are  rarely\\\\ndiagnosed  at  schools.  Due  to  these  significant  numbers,\\\\nVision  Express  decided  to  launch  a  specific  children\\\\\\'s\\\\nprogram,  which  comprises  all  elements  of  the  customer\\\\njourney  for  young  customers.  This  includes  eye  tests,\\\\nproduct assortments and even related commercial policies.\\\\nThe new approach was so successful that it helped position\\\\nVision Express to become an outstanding optical retailer of\\\\nchoice for parents to select the best eye correction solutions\\\\nfor their children.\\\\n\\\\n27\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nF\\\\nO\\\\nC\\\\nU\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cCHAPTER\\\\n\\\\nOur progress in 2020\\\\n\\\\n\\\\x0cDue to the nature and size of our business, we play an important role in the\\\\nlives of our employees, suppliers and customers, as well as in the economies\\\\n\\\\nand  communities  where  we  have  a  presence.

There  is  strong  competition  for  this  type  of\\\\nspecialized  talent,  as  the  demand  for  trained  opticians\\\\naround  the  world  is  high.  However,  there  is  an  ongoing\\\\ndecrease in the number of professionals moving into this\\\\nfield.\\\\n\\\\nTo counter this trend and establish a pipeline of talented\\\\nopticians,  we  have  been  working  with  universities  and\\\\nother  higher  education  institutions  worldwide  to  train\\\\nand develop future eyecare experts.

The  significant  increase  in  average\\\\ntraining hours per FTE can be attributed to the important\\\\nrole that training played in our response to COVID-19, the\\\\nappetite  of  employees  to  acquire  new  skills  while\\\\nworking  remotely,  and  the  launch  of  large  number  of\\\\nglobal training modules to support the further roll out of\\\\nour  strategy.

Despite  this,  we\\\\ncontinued our focus on our international talent mobility\\\\nstrategy, which resulted in several international transfers.\\\\n\\\\nEncouraging talent with our Leadership Lens Profile\\\\nGrandVision  leaders  share  several  attributes.  They  put\\\\nthe  customer  at  the  heart  of  all  of  their  decisions.  They\\\\ncreate a shared direction which energizes our people and\\\\nbrings  out  the  best  in  them.  They  are  entrepreneurs  at\\\\nheart with a focus on delivering excellence in execution\\\\nand  results  today,  while  preparing  our  organization  for\\\\ntomorrow.

Although  this  objective  has  not\\\\ncurrently  been  met  by  GrandVision,  we  made  the  first\\\\nstep by appointing a female Supervisory Board member\\\\nin 2019.\\\\n\\\\nIn  the  long  term,  the  Supervisory  Board  will  ensure  its\\\\ncomposition  and  that  of  the  Management  Board  to\\\\nrepresent a fair and balanced makeup of our employee\\\\nand customer base.\\\\n\\\\nPending  the  completion  of  the  transaction  between\\\\nEssilorLuxottica  and  HAL  regarding \\\\nthe  proposed\\\\nacquisition by EssilorLuxottica of HAL\\\\\\'s 76.72% stake in\\\\nGrandVision,  the  composition  of  the  newly-formed\\\\nSupervisory Board will be made up of six members, four\\\\nof which are female.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cWages paid compared to capital expenditures (full-year)\\\\n\\\\nEconomic contribution (x €1000)\\\\n\\\\n2020\\\\n\\\\n2019\\\\n\\\\n2018\\\\n\\\\n2017\\\\n\\\\n2016\\\\n\\\\n2015\\\\n\\\\nTotal capital expenditure investments\\\\n\\\\n152,194\\\\n\\\\n197,728\\\\n\\\\n210,194\\\\n\\\\n197,497\\\\n\\\\n175,913\\\\n\\\\n161,807\\\\n\\\\nTotal wages and salaries paid\\\\n\\\\n967,851\\\\n\\\\n1,010,934\\\\n\\\\n919,713\\\\n\\\\n830,338\\\\n\\\\n782,743\\\\n\\\\n745,703\\\\n\\\\nFair wages for employees\\\\nBy  paying  fair  wages  to  all  employees,  we  can  improve\\\\nthe  livelihoods  of  our  workforce  and  indirectly  make  a\\\\npositive \\\\nimpact  on  economic  development.  The\\\\nspecialized  level  of  qualifications  for  store  and  other\\\\nemployees, and the high demand for qualified opticians\\\\nand  vision  experts  in  many  markets,  is  reflected  in  the\\\\nlevel  of  contribution  we  pay. \\\\nIn  2020,  we  paid\\\\napproximately EUR one billion in wages and salaries to\\\\nour  employees.  This  is  a  decrease  of  4%  compared  to\\\\n2019,  and  can  be  accounted  for  by  the  decrease  in\\\\nheadcount  and  FTEs  during  2020  through  natural\\\\nattrition.  It  can  also  be  attributed  to  the  support  drawn\\\\nfrom  governments  during  the  period  that  stores  were\\\\nclosed  or  partially  closed  in  response  to  COVID-19\\\\nlimitations.  For  more  details,  please  refer  to  Note  7:\\\\nGovernment Grants.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, as an employer of a global workforce made\\\\nup of almost 70% females, GrandVision pays attention to\\\\nmaintaining a transparent employee remuneration policy\\\\nand  structure  to  avoid  a  gender  pay  gap.

We  measure\\\\nimprove  these  goals  to  contribute  to  higher\\\\nand \\\\nemployee engagement and lower attrition rates.\\\\n\\\\nA strong indicator of this is our employee Net Promoter\\\\nScore  (eNPS),  which  our  local  businesses  measure  and\\\\nuse  to  track  employee  satisfaction.

This was mainly driven\\\\nby  ongoing  training  of  store  employees  and  launching\\\\nnew  products  under  our  iWear  and  Eyexpert  brands.\\\\nThese helped to provide our customers with lenses that\\\\nsuited  their  needs  and  style  preferences  at  affordable\\\\nprices.\\\\n\\\\nMany customers are unaware of the significant benefits\\\\nthat  contact  lenses  can  provide  in  their  daily  lives,\\\\nincluding  freedom  of  movement  when  exercising  and  a\\\\nwider field of vision without eyeglass frames. This is why\\\\nwe  leveraged  our  stores  as  category  entry  points  to\\\\nprovide  an  improved  first  fit  experience  that  supports\\\\ncustomer conversion and focuses on selling contact lens\\\\nsubscriptions.\\\\n\\\\nIn  2020,  we  increased  the  number  of  contact  lens\\\\nsubscriptions, which helped customers fulfil their eyecare\\\\nneeds, especially when their mobility was limited during\\\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. This gave us an opportunity to\\\\nattract  new  customers  to  our  subscription  model  and\\\\nreinforce its convenience and benefits. And by year-end,\\\\nwe  held  750,000  subscriptions,  a  slight \\\\nincrease\\\\ncompared to 2019.\\\\n\\\\nWe also used 2020 to expand the roll out of our contact\\\\nlens subscription model to more retail brands.

Additionally,  they\\\\npartnered  with  our  strategic  suppliers  to  create  iWear\\\\nSlim,  a  more  sustainable  product  line.  They  use  less\\\\nplastic and aluminum, and take up less volume. And the\\\\niWear  Slim  box  is  made  using  recycled  molds  from  our\\\\ncontact \\\\nin  10\\\\nlens  production  process.

We  expect  our\\\\nsuppliers to comply with the regulatory requirements of\\\\nthe  territories  where  our  Exclusive  Brand  products  are\\\\nsold. We control this through our supplier audit program,\\\\nwhich  focuses  on  product  quality,  labor  conditions  and\\\\nhuman rights.\\\\n\\\\nSupplier audit program\\\\nWe  use  third-party  audits  and  an  SGS-certified  supplier\\\\naudit  rating  system,  the  world’s  leading  inspection,\\\\n\\\\nThese SGS audits follow the SA8000 Standards of social\\\\ncertification.

Since  eyeglass  frames  are  medical\\\\ndevices, we make sure they meet strict safety regulations\\\\nto  fulfil  all  customer  and  market  expectations.  We\\\\ncollaborate  with  cross-departmental  representatives  at\\\\nour local retail brands and manufacturing sites to assess\\\\nrelevant quality requirements and related risks.\\\\n\\\\nWe  perform  product  tests  for  ISO  standards  12870\\\\n(eyeglasses) and 12312-1 (sunglasses) in internationally-\\\\naccredited  laboratories.  This  is  to  confirm  our  eyewear\\\\nand eyecare products are safe and effective, as required\\\\nby  applicable  regulations.  We  also  work  closely  with\\\\nsubcontractors to resolve potential issues at the start of\\\\nthe  manufacturing  process  by  performing  in-house\\\\nquality  checks  on  product  prototypes.  Then  we  perform\\\\ninspections  on  finished  products  to  guarantee  stringent\\\\ncontrol and increase operational flexibility.\\\\n\\\\n2020 accomplishments and future goals\\\\nOur  biggest  project  in  2020  was  establishing  a  Quality\\\\nManagement  System  in  accordance  with  ISO  13485,\\\\nrequired  by  the  Medical  Device  Regulation  (MDR).  This\\\\nwas implemented in all the countries where we operate.\\\\nThe  MDR  defines  quality  and  regulatory  matters  in  the\\\\nmedical  device  industry,  and  GrandVision  is  on  track  to\\\\nmeet these objectives and compliance regulations.\\\\n\\\\nIn  2021,  our  Quality  &  Regulatory  (QARA)  team  will\\\\nimprove our quality and regulatory compliance, including\\\\nachieving  ISO  13485  certification,  establishing  updated\\\\nproduct quality requirements and improving compliance\\\\nprocesses.\\\\n\\\\nPost-market surveillance\\\\nOur  global  complaint-handling  system  allows  us  to\\\\ncollect,  review  and  address  our  customers’  product-\\\\nrelated complaints and feedback.

Our  network\\\\noperates and maximizes efficiencies by streamlining the\\\\nedging,  mounting  and  finishing  processes  for  the\\\\nmajority of spectacles purchased in GrandVision stores.\\\\n\\\\nThis manufacturing site network includes the Porto RFH,\\\\nwhich  is  a  blueprint  for  all  other  RFHs  that  we  will\\\\ntransform \\\\nin  the  upcoming  years.  We  expect  this\\\\nstandardized  and  centralized  network  structure  to  yield\\\\nsignificant  benefits.  This  includes  improved  customer\\\\nexperience,  better  lead  times,  product  availability,  and\\\\nsignificant efficiency gains in operating costs and working\\\\ncapital.\\\\n\\\\nThe Porto RFH serves our retail brands in Italy, Denmark,\\\\nSweden,  Portugal  and  Spain  and  further  optimizes  our\\\\noperations in these countries. In 1Q 2021 it will expand\\\\nits services, and we will also upgrade our manufacturing\\\\nsite  in  the  U.K.  to  an  RFH  modeled  after  our  Porto\\\\nblueprint \\\\nto  accommodate  GrandVision\\\\\\'s  ongoing\\\\nomnichannel  ambitions  regarding  subscriptions  and  e-\\\\ncommerce.\\\\n\\\\nThis  upgraded  network  will  become  essential \\\\nto\\\\nsupporting our instore showroom model that allows our\\\\nstores  to  only  carry  try-on  inventory  of  optical  frames.\\\\nFrames  in  our  stores\\\\\\'  displays  are  considered  samples,\\\\nand  customers  can  select  the  styles  they  like  in  this\\\\nconvenient  setting.  Once  a  customer  places  an  order,\\\\nboth  the  frame  and  lenses  are  sent  from  our  central\\\\ninventory in the manufacturing sites. When the last pair\\\\nof frames of a certain model is sold in the store, we finish\\\\nit using remote edging services.\\\\n\\\\nBy  the  end  of  2020,  we  successfully  implemented  our\\\\nshowroom model in France, Finland, Denmark, Sweden,\\\\nGermany and the U.K. In 2021, we will roll out this model\\\\nto The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Italy and Portugal.\\\\n\\\\nBy  strengthening  our  manufacturing  site  network  and\\\\nestablishing our store showroom model, we improve our\\\\nsupply  chain  and  logistics,  increase  product  quality  and\\\\nconsistency, reduce lead time and environmental impact,\\\\nand  increase  lean  operations.  This  concept  allows  our\\\\nstore  employees  to  focus  more  on  customer  service\\\\nrather  than  manually  finishing  prescription  glasses  and\\\\nsunglasses.\\\\n\\\\ncompany, \\\\n\\\\nContinuous manufacturing site improvements\\\\nWe strive to continuously improve our legal compliance\\\\nwith \\\\nlocal  Environment,  Health  and  Safety  (EHS)\\\\nregulations.  That\\\\\\'s  why  we  partner  with  Ramboll,  a\\\\nleading  engineering \\\\nsupport  our\\\\nmanufacturing  site  compliance  journey.  We  employ\\\\ndedicated  environment  management  system  personnel\\\\nto  keep  track  of  our  progress,  and  educate  our  site\\\\nemployees  on  EHS  topics.  We  will  carry  out  external\\\\nmanufacturing  site  audits  for  EHS  compliance  and\\\\nadditional  topics  in  2021.  We  expect  the  outcome  of\\\\nthese audits to help us improve our working environment\\\\nand further reduce our CO2 impact.\\\\n\\\\nto \\\\n\\\\nWe \\\\\\'Reduce & Replace\\\\\\' plastic waste\\\\nSeveral  of  our  retail  brands  implemented  programs  to\\\\nminimize  plastic  packaging  and  ship  reusable  boxes\\\\nbetween manufacturing sites and stores, which reduced\\\\ntheir outbound CO2 footprint. For example, in 2020, our\\\\nGerman  retail  brand  Apollo  saved  117  tons  of  CO2  by\\\\nintroducing additional initiatives to its \\\\\\'Reduce & Replace\\\\\\'\\\\nprogram by expanding its reach beyond logistics:\\\\n\\\\n• Eliminate plastic bags from all stores\\\\n• Eliminate helium-filled promotional balloons\\\\n• Deliver eyeglass lenses to stores in FSC-certified paper\\\\n\\\\ninstead of plastic\\\\n\\\\n• Replace consignment lens plastic packaging to paper\\\\n\\\\n(about 70% implemented currently)\\\\n\\\\nIn  2021,  the  retail  brand  will  further  reduce  suppliers\\\\\\'\\\\npackaging waste and work to become carbon neutral.\\\\n\\\\nResponsible resource use in our manufacturing sites\\\\nWe track the environmental impact of our manufacturing\\\\nprocesses and the materials we use — including those for\\\\neyeglass frames, lenses and packaging, as well as water\\\\nusage, waste streams, gas and electricity.\\\\n\\\\nWe  are  aware  of  the  environmental  impact  of  the\\\\nmaterials  we  use  to  make  our  eyeglasses.  This  includes\\\\nacetate  (a  plastic  blend  of  cotton),  metals,  plastic  for\\\\nlenses, and plastic and cardboard packaging. In 2021 we\\\\nwill complete a Life Cycle Assessment on the end-to-end\\\\nProduct Value Chain and impact of three of our products,\\\\nincluding raw materials, packaging and lenses.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cThrough  this  study,  we  will  gain  a  more  granular  and\\\\nconcrete overview of our carbon footprint and develop a\\\\nplan  to  tackle  its  reduction.

In  order  to  deliver\\\\nproducts  to  our  customers  on  time,  we  had  to  ship\\\\nproducts by air transport instead of ocean transport. We\\\\ncan  also  attribute  about  5%  of  these  inbound  CO2\\\\nemissions to retail brand emergency PPE shipments.\\\\n\\\\nNew  for  2020  is  the  inclusion  of  direct  deliveries  from\\\\nLatin  America  in  our  outbound  CO2  calculations.  This\\\\nadditional  data  accounts  for  about  52%  of  our  2020\\\\noutbound CO2 emissions.\\\\n\\\\nOur  goal  is  to  keep  balancing  customer  demand  while\\\\nreducing the environmental impact of our transportation\\\\nmodes.  In  2021,  we  will  establish  and  implement  more\\\\nenvironmentally-focused KPIs to lay the foundation for a\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cspeedy  delivery  to  our  customers.  That\\\\\\'s  why  we\\\\nimplemented  emissions-reducing  practices  since  2019\\\\ninto our logistics with the following projects that have:\\\\n\\\\n• Reduced packaging material by optimizing box sizes\\\\n\\\\n- Result:  Used  fewer  cartons  and  reduced  empty\\\\n\\\\nspace/volume during transportation.\\\\n- Example:  Optimizing  box  sizes \\\\n\\\\nreduced  an\\\\nestimated 20% of packaging material used (carton).\\\\nThis  reduced  an  estimated  5% \\\\nin\\\\ntransported  weight  on  inbound  ocean  and  air,  as\\\\nwell as outbound truck transport.\\\\n• Consolidated volume to optimize transport\\\\n\\\\nto  20% \\\\n\\\\n- Result: Fuller container loads shipped using ocean\\\\ntransport  and  more  efficient  truck  loads  for  road\\\\ntransport.\\\\n\\\\n- Example:  We  introduced  consolidation  points  in\\\\nAsia, which optimized inbound flow of products by\\\\nair and ocean. This will lead to an estimated yearly\\\\nsavings of 6% on CO2 emissions.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough we planned to roll out more initiatives to lower\\\\nour transportation-related carbon emissions in 2020, this\\\\nwas  not  possible  due  to  a  delay  in  our  manufacturing\\\\nactivities related to COVID-19 limitations. And this meant\\\\nwe had to rely more heavily on transporting our products\\\\nby air instead of ocean shipping. In 2021, we intend to get\\\\nback on track with these initiatives.\\\\n\\\\ngreen  transportation  program.  We  will  also  explore  the\\\\npotential of reverse logistics, which is possible thanks to\\\\nmanufacturing \\\\nfurther\\\\nsite \\\\nstreamlined processes.\\\\n\\\\ncentralization \\\\n\\\\nand \\\\n\\\\nReducing CO2 emissions by rail transport\\\\nAs we work to reduce our negative environmental impact\\\\nin  line  with  the  global  climate  change  agenda,  we  are\\\\nexploring  more  ways \\\\nto  our\\\\nmanufacturing  sites  and  stores.  We  are  aware  of  the\\\\nintense environmental impact that shipping products by\\\\nplane has and are reviewing if there are opportunities to\\\\nuse a different method of product transportation.\\\\n\\\\nto  ship  products \\\\n\\\\nSpecifically,  we  are  considering  shipping  eyeglass  and\\\\nsunglass cases by train as they are more durable and less\\\\ntime-sensitive  products  for  our  customers,  compared  to\\\\ncustom glasses, sunglasses and contact lens orders.\\\\n\\\\nIn  addition  to  shipping  cases,  we  are  assessing  more\\\\nfrequent  railway  shipping  methods  for  all  inbound  and\\\\noutbound  deliveries  to  and  from  our  cross-docks.\\\\nHowever,  we  are  waiting  to  make  this  decision  until\\\\nrailway  shipping  is  less  affected  by  the  COVID-19\\\\npandemic  to  deliver  products  to  our  retail  brands  as\\\\nquickly  as  possible  and  avoid  additional  transportation\\\\ncosts.\\\\n\\\\nImproved packaging reduces environmental impact\\\\nWhile air transportation is CO2-intensive, it is an essential\\\\nelement  of  our  transportation  logistics  that  guarantees\\\\n\\\\n48\\\\n\\\\nO\\\\nU\\\\nR\\\\nP\\\\nR\\\\nO\\\\nG\\\\nR\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nS\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\n2\\\\n0\\\\n2\\\\n0\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c2.6. End-of-product lifecycles\\\\n\\\\nAlthough  eyeglass  frames  and  sunglasses  have  long\\\\nlifecycles  and  are  replaced  every  two  to  three  years,  we\\\\nfind ways to extend their usage to create more purpose\\\\nand reduce environmental impact.

We donate as\\\\nmany  of  these  as  possible  to  NGOs  and  research  or\\\\neducational institutions to help people who can\\\\\\'t afford\\\\ncorrective  eyewear,  or  to  help  students  and  researchers\\\\nadvance their studies.\\\\n\\\\nYou  can  read  more  about  these  collaborations  and\\\\ndonations  in  Section  \\\\\\'Giving  back  to  our  communities\\\\nand reducing environmental impact\\\\\\' in this report.\\\\n\\\\nContact lenses: A surprising source of pollution\\\\nDid  you  know  that  billions  of  contact  lenses  are  not\\\\nproperly  disposed  of  and  add  to  the  plastics  pollution\\\\nproblem  we  currently  face?  According  to  research  from\\\\nArizona  State  University,  Americans  alone  flush  nearly\\\\n2.9 billion contact lenses down the drain every year. This\\\\n\\\\nis  why  in  2020,  we  focused  on  the  contact  lens  end-of-\\\\nproduct lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\nIn  September,  we  launched  a  contact  lens  recycling\\\\nprogram  in  our  Danish  retail  brand  Synoptik,  called\\\\nGenSyn. It\\\\\\'s a collaboration with lensmaker CooperVision\\\\nand  corporate  recycling  company  TerraCycle.  The\\\\nprogram allows all contact lens wearers, even if they are\\\\nnot Synoptik customers, to dispose of their contact lenses\\\\nand packaging at any of the 102 Synoptik store locations\\\\nwith dedicated recycling receptacles.\\\\n\\\\nIn  the  first  three  months  of  the  program,  we  collected\\\\n46kg  of  waste.  For  every  half-kilogram  of  contact  lens\\\\nwaste  Synoptik  collects,  it  donates  EUR  1.50  to  Dansk\\\\nNaturfredningsforening,  the  Danish  Society  for  Nature\\\\nConservation.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally,  Synoptik  in  Denmark  and  Sweden  have\\\\nsaved more than 54,000 unused packs of contact lenses\\\\nfrom  waste  streams.  When  changing  their  prescription\\\\nsubscriptions, customers sometimes end up with unused,\\\\nunpacked  boxes  of  contact  lenses.  Now  they  can  return\\\\nthese to our Synoptik stores and our colleagues check if\\\\nthe  lenses  and  their  packaging  are  intact.  If  they  are\\\\nunused and in perfect condition, Synoptik sends them to\\\\nother Danish and Swedish contact lens subscribers with\\\\nthe same vision corrections.\\\\n\\\\nIn  2021,  we  will  continue  to  measure  the  progress  of\\\\nthese successful programs as well as continue to launch\\\\nthem in other markets.\\\\n\\\\n49\\\\n\\\\nO\\\\nU\\\\nR\\\\nP\\\\nR\\\\nO\\\\nG\\\\nR\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nS\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\n2\\\\n0\\\\n2\\\\n0\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cInbound / Outbound / Business travel / Employee commuting (HQ)Heating / Cooling / Lighting / Use of machineryHeating / Cooling / Lighting4.15 kiloton CO2 (-4.6% vs. 2019)*2.88 kiloton CO2 (-15.3% vs. 2019)CO2 emissions (in kilotons)0-11-22-33-44-55-633.87 kiloton CO2 (-38.4% vs. 2019)Manufacturing sitesTransportationOur store networkSustainable products• Introduce more sustainable in-house and third-party brands to the markets where we are present • Turn the DbyD brand into a 100% sustainability- driven brand by 2025Second life and recycling programs• Eyeglasses and sunglasses: We run second-life programs to extend the duration of use of our products • Contact lenses: Piloted contact lens recycling program in Denmark, to be extended to further markets; demo lens and cutting waste recycling have been tested in a number of markets, investigating opportunities to initiate in further locations• (Plastic) packaging: Programs to to minimize plas-tic packaging and reduce waste in local operations (see \\\\\\'Reduce & Replace\\\\\\' story in section 2.4) • Office supplies: Cutting down on single-use plas-tic and paper in local offices and operationsEfficient resource use• Following our RFH centralization strategy will lead to better opportunities for waste reduction and recycling • Optimized packaging in inbound and outbound transportation • Implementing LED lighting across store network and increasing the usage of renewable electricity • Reducing waste in stores by using UV-C disinfection devices• Reduce our overall energy consumption and Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% in 2025 compared to our 2018 consumption• Reduce the CO2 emissions per processed spectacle by 20% in 2025 compared to our 2016 consumption• Reduce the CO2 emissions per transported spectacle by 30% in 2025 compared to our 2016 consumption• Equip all our stores with LED lighting by 2025• Centralize 85% our final production activities, which include edging and mounting lenses, by 2025* We are conducting a Life Cycle Assessment study to better understand the emissions of our entire supply chain* We plan to set new CO2-related targets in 2021Our main CO2 emissions sourcesOUR CO2 IMPACT MAP FROM STORES AND MANUFACTURING BASED ON CURRENT DATA AVAILABILITY FROM OWNED STORESTARGETS AND AMBITIONS *INITIATIVES TO REDUCE OUR CLIMATE IMPACT\\\\x0c3.

The  retail  brand  noticed  that  demand  for\\\\nglasses, sunglasses and contact lenses remained high, in\\\\nspite of limits to store visits. To solve this challenge, our\\\\nBrazilian teams launched \\\\\\'GV Móvel,\\\\\\' a mobile store that\\\\ndrove  near  their  customers  and  was  a  convenient,  safe\\\\noption  for  them  to  buy  prescription  glasses,  sunglasses\\\\nand contact lenses in their own neighborhoods.\\\\n\\\\nUnlike individual retail stores, GV Móvel was a convenient\\\\nway  to  bring  our  products  and  services  directly  to\\\\ncustomers, as well as schedule visits to companies, other\\\\norganizations  and  large  apartment  complexes  that  are\\\\ntraditional to the city landscape.\\\\n\\\\nThe  retail  brand  ensured  GV  Móvel  staff  followed  the\\\\nWorld  Health  Organization  (WHO)  and  Centers  for\\\\nDisease Control (CDC) and Prevention guidelines to keep\\\\nthe van clean and protect our employees and customers\\\\nin line with COVID-19 regulations.\\\\n\\\\nGV  Móvel  offered  customers  the  best  products  and\\\\neyecare  services  available  in  a  convenient  and  safe\\\\nmobile  setting,  and  provided  advantages  for  partner\\\\ncompanies, including:\\\\n\\\\n• Exclusive discounts\\\\n• Prompt delivery of reading glasses\\\\n• Specially-priced glasses and sunglasses\\\\n\\\\nInvesting in our customer experience\\\\nIn  2020,  our  capital  expenditure  investments  excluding\\\\nacquisitions  totaled  EUR  152  million.  The  majority  of\\\\ninvested capital was used to optimize our existing store\\\\nnetwork, including safety equipment in stores to ensure a\\\\nsecure environment for employees and customers during\\\\nthe  COVID-19  pandemic.  We  continue  to  improve  our\\\\nemployees’ work environments, enhance our operations\\\\nand maintain responsive customer service.\\\\n\\\\nThe capital invested in non-store assets mainly supports\\\\nour  digital  strategy  and  omnichannel  capabilities.

More than 3,600 stores (about 58% of our\\\\nown  stores)  are  equipped  with  LED  lighting,  and  our\\\\ntarget is to equip every store by 2025.\\\\n\\\\nIn  2020,  we  retrofitted  471  stores,  which  led  to  an\\\\nestimated:\\\\n\\\\n• 3.51 GWh less energy consumption\\\\n• 1,451 tons avoided CO2 emissions\\\\n\\\\nSince  we  started  using  them,  our  LED-equipped  stores\\\\nhave helped us to annually:\\\\n\\\\n• Consume 27.3 GWh less energy\\\\n• Avoid emitting 8,845 tons CO2\\\\n\\\\nIf we achieve our target in 2025, we can avoid the annual\\\\nconsumption  of  46.9  GWh  and  emission  of  14,164  tons\\\\nCO2. This reduced electricity consumption can also lead\\\\nto  positive  financial  effects  for  GrandVision  thanks  to\\\\nreduced electricity costs.\\\\n\\\\n3.3. Giving back to our communities and\\\\nreducing environmental impact\\\\n\\\\nto \\\\n\\\\nintegrate  Corporate\\\\nIn  2020,  we  continued \\\\nResponsibility  &  Sustainability  (CSR)  into  GrandVision\\\\\\'s\\\\ngroup  strategy  and  increase  our  environmental,  social\\\\nand  corporate  governance  (ESG)  commitments.  We\\\\nonboarded  all  GrandVision  retail  brands  to  the  global\\\\nCSR concept – GrandVision Cares and continue to work\\\\non our guiding ESG priorities, which include to:\\\\n\\\\n• Foster an inclusive and diverse work environment\\\\n• Reduce  environmental  impact  of  supply  chain  and\\\\n\\\\nstore operations\\\\n\\\\n• Give  access  to  high-quality,  affordable  eyecare  to\\\\n\\\\ncustomers and donate to those in need\\\\n\\\\nHaving  a  strong  CSR  agenda  is  a  great  boost  for\\\\nemployee engagement and motivation, and participation\\\\nin  GrandVision  CSR  activities  has  been  increasing  and\\\\nbecome  source  of  employee  pride.  Thanks  to  this,  our\\\\nlocal  management  teams  and  CSR  ambassadors  have\\\\nassisted  with  the  CSR  strategy  rollout  and  established\\\\nlocal  CSR  governance  teams.  These  teams  include\\\\nrepresentatives from strategic functions such as Product\\\\nValue  Chain,  finance,  People  &  Culture,  and  marketing\\\\nand communications.\\\\n\\\\nFostering a culture of inclusion and diversity\\\\nGrandVision\\\\\\'s  goal  is  to  foster  an  inclusive  culture  that\\\\nenables  our  ambition  to  grow  and  support  a  diverse\\\\nworkforce.  One  of  the  major  topics  on  the  agenda  for\\\\n2020 and 2021 is gender diversity and equality. Gender\\\\nequality  is  a  fundamental  human  right  and  a  necessary\\\\nfoundation  for  a  peaceful,  prosperous,  and  sustainable\\\\nworld.  GrandVision’s  female  employees  are  an  integral\\\\npart  of  our  business  and  are  vital  to  our  commercial\\\\nsuccess.  We  want  to  make  sure  they  get  the  same\\\\nchances  to  grow,  develop  and  thrive  as  their  male\\\\ncounterparts.\\\\n\\\\ntrend \\\\n\\\\nHowever,  we  noticed  a \\\\nthat  fewer  female\\\\nemployees reach higher positions in sales and operations\\\\nroles at the management level. It was important for us to\\\\nfirst learn why there is this trend at GrandVision and then\\\\nplan how we could change it for the better.\\\\n\\\\nOne  of  our  initiatives  was  to  bring  together  our  own\\\\ndiversity  leaders  from  across  the  globe  along  with  a\\\\nfrom  Rotterdam  School  of\\\\nstudents \\\\ngroup  of \\\\nManagement-Erasmus  University \\\\nfresh\\\\nperspective  on  this  social  issue  and  find  a  solution  to\\\\nresolve  it.  This  initiative  is  part  of  a  program  called  the\\\\nStudent  SDG  Challenge.  It  pairs  Dutch  universities  with\\\\nNetherlands-based  companies  to  solve  a  business\\\\nproblem  related  to  the  UN  Sustainable  Development\\\\nGoals.

Our  French  retail  brands\\\\nreduced  their  paper  usage  by  updating  the  customer\\\\nsignature process from paper-based to digital signatures.\\\\nAnd their customers can now opt in to receive quotes and\\\\nreceipts  directly  by  email.

Our  ongoing  goal  is  to  raise\\\\nawareness about the world’s most common eye diseases\\\\nand make eyecare more accessible for all. In 2020, nearly\\\\nall our retail brands hosted volunteer events, donated eye\\\\ntests and eyewear and raised funds for the cause.\\\\nIn  2021,  we  are  further  aligning  our  CSR  Ambassador\\\\ncommunications with GrandVision’s Eye Care Council to\\\\neducate  others  about  eye  health  and  raise  awareness\\\\nabout  eye  conditions  that  affect  millions  of  people\\\\naround the world like myopia, glaucoma and age-related\\\\nmacular degeneration. \\\\n\\\\n•\\\\n\\\\nGive  back  to  our  communities  and  take  care  of  the\\\\nenvironment:  Despite  limitations  of  COVID-19  pandemic\\\\nsafety  guidelines,  our  CSR  Ambassadors  organized\\\\ncharitable  events  across  the  globe  and  reduced  waste\\\\nproduction  in  our  stores  and  offices.  They  also  helped\\\\ncommunities in need during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\\\n\\\\nMany  of  our  retail  brands  donated  personal  protective\\\\nequipment (PPEs), contact lenses, glasses and accessories to\\\\nfrontline  healthcare  workers  and  people  in  dire  economic\\\\nsituations.  For  example,  the  GrandVision  headquarters\\\\ndonated more than 40,000 face masks to a local food bank,\\\\nGrandVision  Benelux  generously  donated  10,000  pairs  of\\\\nsafety glasses to local healthcare workers, and GrandVision\\\\nPortugal  donated  food  to  families  in  need  and  laptops  to\\\\nstudents without access to remote learning technology.\\\\n\\\\nOur Ambassadors also helped reduce COVID-19 pandemic-\\\\nrelated  waste  in  stores,  manufacturing  sites  and  offices.\\\\nThey made their own hand sanitizers in reusable containers\\\\naccording to World Health Organization standards.

This\\\\ncould  equal  175,000  wipes  used  per  week,  or  nearly\\\\nnine  million  wipes  per  year.  Currently,  about  60%  of  the\\\\nGrandVision  store  network  have  implemented  UV-C  boxes,\\\\ntotaling nearly 4,300 units.\\\\n\\\\nIn  addition,  Ambassadors  made  significant  progress  in\\\\nhelping communities where we are based.

We embarked on\\\\na comprehensive post-merger integration plan, including the\\\\nrepositioning of this retail brand. We steered McOptic back\\\\nto its roots as a \\\\\\'value for money\\\\\\' player with the assortment,\\\\npricing and commercial policies to support this positioning.\\\\nWe  took  particular  care  and  effort \\\\nin  securing  the\\\\nonboarding  and  involvement  of  the  McOptic  team  in  both\\\\nthe decision-making and the change management journey.\\\\nThis included multilingual kick-off sessions for all employees\\\\nin French, German and Italian to explain our new strategy for\\\\nthe brand to McOptic teams. This careful planning inspired\\\\nemployees  and  secured  their  engagement  —  our  key  to\\\\nsuccess in this process.\\\\n\\\\nHow we repositioned McOptic\\\\nWe  repositioned  the  McOptic  brand  through  delivering  a\\\\ncompletely  renewed  product  assortment,  a  new  pricing\\\\npolicy  and  updated  commercial  policies.  These  changes\\\\ncame together in upgraded McOptic stores, designed using\\\\nour latest store concept as a blueprint. We also changed our\\\\ncommunication  with  customers  to  underscore  McOptic’s\\\\nposition  as  a  value  for  money  player.  These  commercial\\\\nupdates were implemented by 4Q 2020, and by the end of\\\\n1Q  2021  the  majority  of  our  60  McOptic  stores  will  be\\\\nrefitted to the new store concept.\\\\n\\\\nSecuring a successful integration built on a strong\\\\nfoundation\\\\nWhen  we  welcomed  McOptic \\\\ninto  VisilabGroup  and\\\\nGrandVision, we developed a comprehensive plan to ensure\\\\na successful integration. It was critical for us to secure team\\\\nin  onboarding,\\\\nengagement  through  extensive  efforts \\\\ntraining as well as McOptic involvement in key decisions. We\\\\nassembled  an \\\\nintegration  made  up  of  key  McOptic,\\\\nVisilabGroup  and  GrandVision  leaders  and  ensured  this\\\\nteam  was  composed  of  employees  possessing  the  right\\\\nknowledge, best skills and competencies to foster a positive\\\\nand productive process.

While  we  introduced  changes\\\\ngradually through 2020, we were able to see the full impact\\\\nin 4Q 2020. This included higher levels of McOptic employee\\\\nsatisfaction  with  an  average  eNPS  score  of  55,  which\\\\ntranslated  into  improved  instore  service  and  a  higher\\\\ncustomer  satisfaction  score  of  67.

We take calculated business risks to keep\\\\nevolving our business model.\\\\n\\\\n• Pragmatic:  GrandVision  avoids  bureaucracy  and\\\\nis  driven  by\\\\n\\\\nperfectionism,  and  our  culture \\\\neffectiveness and cost consciousness.\\\\n\\\\nEnterprise Risk Management\\\\n\\\\nAt GrandVision, we adopt a sensible risk-taking approach,\\\\nwhich cannot be defined by one figure or formula. We set\\\\nour  risk  boundaries  to  align  with  our  strategy,  values,\\\\npolicies and corporate directives. Our approach depends\\\\non the type of risk, as follows:\\\\n\\\\n• Strategic  risk:  GrandVision \\\\n\\\\ntakes  above-average,\\\\ncalculated and carefully-weighted risk in pursuing our\\\\ngrowth ambitions.\\\\n\\\\n• Operational risk: GrandVision minimizes risks relating\\\\nto the implementation of our strategy, but is not afraid\\\\nto take decisive action in our business operations that\\\\nare designed to improve customer satisfaction.\\\\n\\\\nWe have implemented an annual risk management cycle,\\\\nwhich  identifies  key  risks  and  developments  that  we\\\\ncontinue \\\\nto  address.  Twice  a  year,  all  country\\\\nmanagement  and  central  functional  teams  conduct  risk\\\\nassessments.  Based  on  these  assessments,  and  on  an\\\\nevaluation of the outcomes of risks already identified, we\\\\nupdate the key risks.\\\\n\\\\nIn  2020,  we  identified  approximately  230  risks.  They\\\\nwere  classified  and  consolidated  using  a  quantification\\\\nmethod to weigh potential impacts and likelihoods of the\\\\nvarious  risks.

In addition, we invest in digital\\\\nmarketing  campaigns  and  added-value  sales  promotions  that  enable  us  to\\\\nremain price competitive. To support this strategy, we relentlessly pursue cost\\\\nefficiencies in everything we do, from purchasing products and managing our\\\\nphysical  and  online  stores  to  organizing  back  office  operations.  This  helps\\\\nkeep our retail prices competitive.\\\\n\\\\nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  accelerated  consumer  behavior  changes  towards\\\\nmore  digitally-influenced  sales.  To  respond  to  this  risk,  we  invested  in  our\\\\npeople,  products  and  stores  to  remain  relevant  to  our  customers.  Our\\\\ninvestment in the digital omnichannel customer journey allows customers to\\\\ndecide how, when and where they want to buy our products, preserves our\\\\nvalue  proposition.  It  also  succeeded  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  to\\\\nfacilitate  both  offline  and  online  shopping.  In  addition,  we  monitor  eye\\\\ncorrection  alternatives  that  we  believe  will  slowly  take  hold,  as  many\\\\ncustomers prefer to wear glasses over eye surgery solutions.\\\\n\\\\nOur  diversified  portfolio  in  more  than  40  countries  is  a  strong  mitigating\\\\nfactor  against  individual  country  or  regional  economic  risks.  We  monitor\\\\nthese risks as part of our normal course of business and apply measures such\\\\nas  commercial  promotions,  financial  hedging,  internal  reorganizations  and\\\\ncost savings to counter the potential impact in the short-term. Our integrated\\\\nCSR  focus  also  helps  us  have  a  broader  perspective  on  non-financial\\\\ncontributors to our business and our impact on climate-related issues.\\\\n\\\\nOperational Risk\\\\n\\\\nRisk area and possible impact\\\\n\\\\nOPERATING MODEL\\\\nRisk  of  sub-optimal \\\\nimplementation  of  global\\\\ncapabilities,  including  supply  chain  operations,  will\\\\nresult in inefficiencies, declining product availability\\\\nand loss of confidence.\\\\n\\\\nIMPACT/\\\\nLIKELIHOOD\\\\n\\\\nM/M\\\\n\\\\nHow GrandVision mitigates this risk\\\\n\\\\nThe design of our Product Value Chain has matured to further support our\\\\nend-to-end  processes,  with  a  focus  on  customer  fulfilment  and  product\\\\ncategories.  We  have  Business  Continuity  plans  in  place  in  case  of  natural\\\\ndisasters or other calamities, in addition to specific insurance that will help to\\\\nreduce the financial impact of such events.\\\\n\\\\nTALENT  ATTRACTION  AND  EMPLOYEE\\\\nSAFETY\\\\nTraditionally,  our  focus  is  on  our  strong  expansion\\\\nwhere  we  are  highly  dependent  on  recruiting  and\\\\neducating  new  employees,  especially  opticians.

\\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cNotes to the Consolidated Financial\\\\nStatements\\\\n\\\\n1. General Information\\\\n\\\\nGrandVision  N.V.  (‘the  Company’)  is  a  public  limited  liability  company  and  is  incorporated  and  domiciled  in\\\\nHaarlemmermeer,  the  Netherlands.  GrandVision  N.V.  is  listed  on  the  Euronext  Amsterdam  stock  exchange.  The\\\\nCompany\\\\\\'s Chamber of Commerce registration number is 50338269. The address of its registered office is as follows:\\\\nThe Base, Evert van de Beekstraat 1-80, Tower C, 6th floor, 1118 CL Schiphol, the Netherlands.\\\\n\\\\nAt  31  December  2020,  76.72%  of  the  issued  shares  are  owned  by  HAL  Optical  Investments  B.V.  and  22.98%  by\\\\ninstitutional and retail investors, with the remaining shares held by GrandVision\\\\\\'s Management Board (0.03%) and in\\\\ntreasury (0.27%). HAL Optical Investments B.V. is indirectly controlled by HAL Holding N.V. All HAL Holding N.V. shares\\\\nare held by HAL Trust. HAL Trust is listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange.\\\\n\\\\nOn 31 July 2019, it was announced that EssilorLuxottica had agreed to acquire the 76.62% interest in GrandVision held\\\\nby HAL Optical Investments B.V. GrandVision continues to support EssilorLuxottica with the shared objective to obtain\\\\nregulatory  approval  for  the  closure  of  this  acquisition  within  12  to  24  months  from  the  announcement  date.  The\\\\ntransaction has been unconditionally cleared so far in the United States, Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, and Russia and it is\\\\ncurrently under review in the EU, Chile, and Turkey. On 18 July 2020, EssilorLuxottica initiated summary proceedings\\\\nbefore the District Court of Rotterdam demanding that GrandVision provides to EssilorLuxottica additional information\\\\nin relation to GrandVision\\\\\\'s actions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on its business. On 24 August 2020, the District\\\\nCourt dismissed all claims made by EssilorLuxottica. EssilorLuxottica has appealed the decision of the District Court. On\\\\n30  July  2020,  GrandVision  announced  that  it  had  initiated  arbitration  proceedings  against  EssilorLuxottica  in\\\\nconnection with the material breach notice EssilorLuxottica has sent to GrandVision. These proceedings are currently\\\\nongoing; they are confidential and non-public.\\\\n\\\\nGrandVision N.V. and its subsidiaries (together, referred to as ‘the Group’) comprise a number of optical retail chains\\\\noperated under different retail banners. As of 31 December 2020, the Group, including its associates and joint ventures,\\\\noperated 7,260 (2019: 7,406) optical retail stores (including franchise stores). The average number of employees within\\\\nthe Group during 2020 (excluding the associates and joint ventures) in full-time equivalents was 33,542 (2019: 34,143).\\\\n\\\\n2. Basis of Preparation\\\\n\\\\n2.1. Statement of Compliance\\\\nThese  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting\\\\nStandards  (IFRS)  and  interpretations  issued  by  the  IFRS  Interpretations  Committee  (IFRS  IC)  as  adopted  within  the\\\\nEuropean Union and also comply with the financial reporting requirements included in Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch\\\\nCivil Code.\\\\n\\\\nThe accounting policies based on IFRS have been applied consistently for the years presented in these consolidated\\\\nfinancial statements. There were no changes in the accounting policies applied compared to the previous year, except\\\\nas described in note 2.7.1.\\\\n\\\\n2.2. Basis of Measurement\\\\nThe IFRS financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivatives, share-\\\\nbased payment plans, contingent considerations, certain non-current assets and post-employment benefits.\\\\n\\\\nIn preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements and estimates that affect the\\\\napplication  of  the  Group\\\\\\'s  accounting  policies  and  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,  equity,  liabilities,  commitments,\\\\nincome and expenses.\\\\n\\\\n117\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c118\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\nImplications of COVID-19 on the Group\\\\n\\\\nThe  global  spread  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  during  2020  resulted  in  challenges  for  the  optical  retail  industry,  in\\\\nparticular  in  the  first  half  of  the  year  due  to  a  significant  number  of  temporary  store  closures  in  many  markets,\\\\nrestrictions with regards to openings hours and the performance of essential in-store services in many other regions, as\\\\nwell  as  a  significant  reduction  in  traffic  due  to  consumer  uncertainty.  GrandVision  formed  an  internal  taskforce  to\\\\ncontinuously monitor and proactively manage risks relating to COVID-19 throughout its business, as well as to ensure\\\\nthat publicly available advice was followed and that appropriate safety measures were quickly implemented for the\\\\nemployees and customers. Business continuity plans of the Group and focus on operational excellence, building on a\\\\nstrong foundation of its long-term strategic initiatives, enabled GrandVision to limit the effects of the pandemic and\\\\ncontinue to meet and serve the needs of the customers.\\\\n\\\\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been markedly different in the first half of the year versus the second half of\\\\n2020. In the first half of 2020, and in particular as of March 2020, many of GrandVision\\\\\\'s stores were fully closed or only\\\\npartially open, as GrandVision complied with governmental measures and health authority recommendations around\\\\nthe  world.  Consequentially,  GrandVision  was  impacted  by  various  degrees  of  sales  limitations  and  a  significant\\\\nreduction  in  traffic.  As  the  situation  continued  to  develop  rapidly,  GrandVision  faced  a  negative  revenue  impact  of\\\\n-27.2% against the previous year in the first half year of 2020.\\\\n\\\\nIn  the  first  half  of  the  year,  and  as  soon  as  the  potential  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  became  apparent,\\\\nGrandVision focused on its people, customers and stakeholders as well as the financial health of the company. In this\\\\nperiod, GrandVision swiftly implemented hygiene and safety protocols and equipped stores with distance separations\\\\nand  protective  equipment,  such  as  face  masks  and  hygiene  gels.  In  addition,  the  Group  accelerated  investments  in\\\\ncustomer facing tools such as optical e-commerce functionalities to enable the customers to interact even better with\\\\nGrandVision local online and offline retail brands. GrandVision invested in automated eye measurement equipment\\\\nwhich, together with distance dividers, allowed eye tests at recommended distances.\\\\n\\\\nBy  the  end  of  June,  the  majority  of  the  countries  of  the  Group  started  to  relax  COVID-19  measures  and  restrictions,\\\\nallowing GrandVision to gradually re-open the store network. With the measures and investments taken in the first half\\\\nof the year, GrandVision was able to operate safely with 1.5-2-meter social distancing. By June 2020, GrandVision had\\\\nreturned to full operation, particularly in most of the markets in Europe. In Latin America, where countries had been\\\\nimpacted by COVID-19 later than Europe and North America, stores faced a longer period of store closures or were\\\\noperating with limited opening hours.\\\\n\\\\nThroughout  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  GrandVision  continued  to  make  good  progress  on  the  implementation  of  the\\\\nomnichannel  capabilities  across  the  Group.  This  has  helped  to  better  address,  serve  and  retain  the  customers  and\\\\nresulted in a strong increase in digitally influenced store sales, mainly driven by online appointment booking and e-\\\\nvouchers, as well as direct e-commerce sales.\\\\n\\\\nThe response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020 enabled GrandVision to strongly benefit once the store\\\\nnetwork re-opened from June 2020 onwards. Despite continued depressed levels of customer traffic, high customer\\\\nconversion and favorable product mix resulted in a strong recovery of revenue and profitability in the second half of\\\\n2020. However, towards the end of the year, the second wave impact resulted in a slowdown of the recovery achieved\\\\nin the third and fourth quarters of 2020.\\\\n\\\\nDuring the pandemic, GrandVision worked with key stakeholders such as landlords and banks to mitigate the impact of\\\\nthe  crisis  whilst  engaging  in  dialogue  and  using  governmental  measures  offered  to  help  mitigate  the  impact  of  the\\\\npandemic. GrandVision received support from many of the landlords through agreed rent reductions, details of which\\\\nare  included  in  the  section  on  leases  in  this  report.  Banks  supported  GrandVision  throughout  the  pandemic  by\\\\nproviding a waiver of the bank’s covenants for the duration of 2020 whilst gradually resuming in 2021. A sub-set of the\\\\nbanks agreed to provide GrandVision with an additional Liquidity Facility (RLF) commitment of €400 million for the\\\\nduration of one year and with the option to prolong by another year, further evidencing the confidence in GrandVision.\\\\nGrandVision participated in various governmental programs and measures offered. This included furlough schemes\\\\nand  postponement  of  tax  and/or  social  taxes  payments.  Further  details  on  the  impact  of  such  arrangements  are\\\\nincluded in the section on Financial Risk Management in note 3, and further details are provided in notes 7 and 12 in\\\\nthis report.\\\\n\\\\nGrandVision  management  believes  that  the  long-term  commitment  of  €1,200  million  under  the  Revolving  Credit\\\\nFacility  (RCF),  and  the  additional  Liquidity  Facility  commitment  of  €400  million  will  be  sufficient  in  the  event  of  a\\\\nprolonged COVID-19 pandemic. As of 30 December 2020, 73% of the RCF and 100% of the RLF were available. With the\\\\ndebt markets stabilizing, the interest on Commercial Paper returning to its normal level, and taking into account the\\\\navailable commitments, management believes that GrandVision is in a sound position from a financing point of view\\\\n(see note 3 for more details).\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cTherefore, whilst uncertain, management does not believe, however, that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic would\\\\nhave a material adverse effect on the Group\\\\\\'s financial condition or liquidity.\\\\n\\\\n2.3. Significant Accounting Policies\\\\nThe Group’s significant accounting policies are included in the relevant individual notes to the consolidated financial\\\\nstatements,  as  well  as  the  significant  accounting  estimates  and  judgments  made,  where  applicable,  as  described  in\\\\nnote 2.8.\\\\n\\\\n2.4. Subsidiaries\\\\nSubsidiaries  are  those  entities  over  which  the  Group  has  control.  The  Group  controls  an  entity  when  the  Group  is\\\\nexposed  to,  or  has  rights  to,  variable  returns  from  its  involvement  with  the  entity  and  has  the  ability  to  affect  those\\\\nreturns  through  its  power  over  the  entity.  Subsidiaries  are  fully  consolidated  from  the  date  on  which  control  is\\\\ntransferred  to  the  Group  and  are  no  longer  consolidated  from  the  date  that  control  ceases.  All  intercompany\\\\ntransactions, balances and unrealized gains or losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.\\\\n\\\\n2.5. Foreign Currency\\\\n\\\\n2.5.1. Functional and Presentation Currency\\\\nItems in the consolidated financial statements of the various Group companies are measured in the currency of the\\\\nprimary  economic  environment  in  which  each  entity  operates  (the  functional  currency).  The  consolidated  financial\\\\nstatements  are  presented  in  euros  (€),  this  being  GrandVision’s  presentation  currency.  Amounts  are  shown  in\\\\nthousands of euros, unless stated otherwise.\\\\n\\\\n2.5.2. Transactions, Balances and Translation\\\\nForeign currency  transactions  are  translated  into  the  functional  currency  using the  exchange  rates  prevailing  at  the\\\\ndates of the transactions or valuation when items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from\\\\nthe  settlement  of  such  transactions,  and  from  the  translation  at  year-end  exchange  rates  of  monetary  assets  and\\\\nliabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies,  excluding  foreign  operations  in  hyperinflationary  economies,  are\\\\nrecognized  in  the  consolidated  Income  Statement,  except  when  deferred  in  the  consolidated  Other  Comprehensive\\\\nIncome as qualifying cash flow hedges.\\\\n\\\\nForeign  currency  exchange  gains  and  losses  are  presented  in  the  consolidated  Income  Statement  either  in  the\\\\noperating  result,  if  foreign  currency  transactions  relate  to  operational  activities,  assets  and  liabilities,  or  within  the\\\\nfinancial result for non-operating financial assets and liabilities.\\\\n\\\\n2.5.3. Foreign Subsidiaries\\\\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation,\\\\nare translated into the presentation currency at the exchange rate applicable at the balance sheet date. The income\\\\nand  expenses  of  foreign  subsidiaries  are  translated  into  the  presentation  currency  at  average  exchange  rates  to\\\\napproximate the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Resulting exchange differences are recognized in the\\\\nconsolidated Other Comprehensive Income.\\\\n\\\\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities\\\\nof the foreign operation and are translated at the closing rate.\\\\n\\\\n2.5.4. Hyperinflation Accounting\\\\nThe  Group  applies  hyperinflation  accounting  for  its  operations  in  Argentina.  The  effects  of  this  hyperinflation\\\\naccounting on the consolidated financial figures of the Group are limited, since the operations in Argentina represent a\\\\nlimited part of the total assets and the operating result of the Group.\\\\n\\\\nThe index used to apply hyperinflation accounting is the Retail Price Index published by the Government Board of the\\\\nArgentine Federation of Professional Councils of Economic Sciences (FACPCE).\\\\n\\\\n2.6. Principles for the consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\\\\nThe consolidated statement of cash flows is compiled using the indirect method. The consolidated statement of cash\\\\nflows  distinguishes  between  cash  flows  from  operating,  investing  and  financing  activities.  For  the  purpose  of  the\\\\nconsolidated  statement  of  cash  flows,  cash  and  cash  equivalents  comprise  cash  on  hand,  deposits  held  at  call  with\\\\nbanks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, cash pool balances\\\\nand  bank  overdrafts,  as  they  are  considered  an  integral  part  of  the  Group’s  cash  management.  In  the  consolidated\\\\nBalance Sheet, bank overdrafts and cash pool liabilities are included in borrowings in current liabilities.\\\\n\\\\nCash flows in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of the transaction date.\\\\n\\\\n119\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cInterest paid and received is included under cash flow from financing activities . Cash flows arising from the acquisition\\\\nor disposal of financial interests (subsidiaries and participating interests) are recognized as cash flows from investing\\\\nactivities, taking into account any cash and cash equivalents in these interests. Dividends paid out are recognized as\\\\ncash  flows  from  financing  activities;  dividends  received  are  recognized  as  cash  flows  from  investing  activities.\\\\nRepayments  of  lease  liabilities  and  receipts  from  finance  subleases  including  principal  amount  and  interest  are\\\\nclassified as cash flows from financing activities.\\\\n\\\\n2.7. Changes in Accounting Policies and Disclosures\\\\n\\\\n2.7.1. New and Amended Standards and Interpretations Adopted by the Group\\\\nNew and Amended Standards and Interpretations Adopted by the Group\\\\n\\\\nA number of new or amended standards and interpretations became applicable for the current reporting period and\\\\nthe Group had to change its accounting policies as a result of adopting the following standards, where applicable:\\\\n\\\\n• Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations\\\\n• Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting\\\\n\\\\nEstimates and Errors\\\\n\\\\n• Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and\\\\n\\\\nIFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures\\\\n\\\\n• Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS\\\\n• Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases\\\\n\\\\nAmendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations\\\\n\\\\nThe amendments to IFRS 3 on the definition of a business were issued in 2018 and are effective for accounting periods\\\\nbeginning  on  or  after  1  January  2020.  The  amendments  clarify  whether  an  acquired  set  of  activities  and  assets  is  a\\\\nbusiness  or  not,  which  is  a  key  consideration  in  determining  whether  a  transaction  is  accounted  for  as  a  business\\\\ncombination or an asset acquisition. As from 2020, the Group applies these amendments. These amendments had no\\\\nimpact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.\\\\n\\\\nAmendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: Definition of \"Material\"\\\\n\\\\nThe amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting\\\\nEstimates  and  Errors  on  the  definition  of  \\\\\\'Material\\\\\\'  were  issued  in  2018  and  are  effective  for  accounting  periods\\\\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2020. The amendments were issued to align the definition of ‘material’ across the IFRS\\\\nstandards and to clarify certain aspects of the definition. As from 2020, the Group applies these amendments. These\\\\namendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.\\\\n\\\\nAmendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\\\\n\\\\nThe amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform were issued in 2019 and are effective\\\\nfor  accounting  periods  beginning  on  or  after  1  January  2020.  Many  interest  rate  benchmarks  such  as  LIBOR  (the\\\\nLondon Inter-Bank Offered Rate) are in the process of being replaced. There will be financial reporting implications to\\\\nthis  reform,  with  some  effects  arising  even  before  a  particular  interest  rate  benchmark  has  been  replaced  (pre-\\\\nreplacement issues).The amendments provides relief from certain hedge accounting requirements in order to avoid\\\\nunnecessary  discontinuation  of  existing  hedge  relationships  during  the  period  of  uncertainty  over  interest  rate\\\\nbenchmark reform. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.\\\\n\\\\nAmendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS\\\\n\\\\nAmendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS were issued in 2018 and are effective for accounting\\\\nperiods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. The amendments were issued to align various standards to reflect the\\\\nissue  of  the  revised  Conceptual  Framework  for  Financial  Reporting.  In  addition,  the  amendments  clarify  that  the\\\\ndefinitions of asset and liability applied in certain standards have not been revised, with the new definitions included in\\\\nthe new conceptual framework. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the\\\\nGroup.\\\\n\\\\n120\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cAmendments to IFRS 16 Leases: COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions\\\\n\\\\nThe  amendment  to  IFRS  16  -  COVID-19-Related  Rent  Concessions  was  issued  in  2020  and  is  effective  for  annual\\\\nperiods beginning on or after 1 June 2020. This amendment provides practical relief for lessees in accounting for rent\\\\nconcessions. As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to treat eligible COVID-19-related rent concession as a\\\\nlease modification, and instead is permitted to account for it as if it was not lease modification. The Group has elected\\\\nto adopt these changes early. The Group applied the practical expedient to all the rent concessions, which meet the\\\\ncriteria for the reporting periods starting 1 January 2020. The impact of the amendment and new accounting policies\\\\nare disclosed in Leases (note 12).\\\\n\\\\n2.7.2. New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations Issued But Not Effective for the Reported Period and Not\\\\n\\\\nAdopted Early\\\\n\\\\nThe  following  new  standards  and  amendments  to  standards  and  interpretations  are  effective  for  annual  periods\\\\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2021 and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group\\\\\\'s consolidated\\\\nfinancial statements:\\\\n\\\\n•\\\\n\\\\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (issued on 18 May 2017), including Amendments to IFRS 17, IFRS 4 and deferral of\\\\nIFRS 9 (issued on 25 June 2020);\\\\n\\\\n• Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\\\\nand Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current - Deferral of Effective Date (issued on 23 January 2020 and\\\\n15 July 2020, respectively);\\\\n\\\\n• Amendments  to  IFRS  3  Business  Combinations;  IAS  16  Property,  Plant  and  Equipment;  IAS  37  Provisions,\\\\n\\\\nContingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets; Annual Improvements 2018-2020 (issued 14 May 2020);\\\\n\\\\n• Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts – deferral of IFRS19 (issued on 25 June 2020);\\\\n• Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 (issued on\\\\n\\\\n27 August 2020).\\\\n\\\\n2.8.

Financial Risk Management\\\\n\\\\n3.1. Financial Risk Factors\\\\nThe Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks (currency risk, interest rate risk, price risk),\\\\ncredit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial\\\\nmarkets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. The Group uses\\\\nderivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.\\\\n\\\\nThe Group’s management provides principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas,\\\\nsuch  as  foreign  exchange  risk,  interest  rate  risk,  credit  risk  and  the  use  of  derivative  and  non-derivative  financial\\\\ninstruments.\\\\n\\\\n3.1.1. Market Risk\\\\n\\\\n(i) Foreign exchange risk\\\\nForeign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognized assets or liabilities are denominated\\\\nin a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. The Group treasury’s risk management policy is to hedge the\\\\nexpected cash flows in most currencies, mainly by making use of derivatives as described in note 23.\\\\n\\\\nThe majority of the Group operations takes place in the ‘eurozone’, which comprises 58% (2019: 58%) of total revenue.\\\\nTranslation exposure to foreign exchange risk relates to those activities outside the eurozone, whose net assets are\\\\nexposed to foreign currency translation risk. The currency translation risk is not hedged.\\\\n\\\\n122\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\nIf the currencies had been 5% weaker against the euro with all other variables held constant, the Group’s result for the\\\\nyear would  have  been  7.2%  higher  (2019:  0.8%  higher)  of which  5.9%  related  of  USD  (2019:  2.2%  higher  impact  of\\\\nmainly USD offset by 1.4% lower impact of mainly currencies in Europe (HUF, SEK, PLN)) and equity would have been\\\\n2.4% lower (2019: 3.0% lower), of which 0.7% lower impact of GBP (2019: 0.8% lower impact of GBP).\\\\n\\\\nForeign  exchange  risks  with  respect  to  commercial  transactions  other  than  in  the  functional  currency  are  mainly\\\\nrelated to US dollar denominated purchases of goods in Asia, indirect exposure on goods and services invoiced in the\\\\nfunctional currency but of which the underlying exposure is in a non-functional currency.\\\\n\\\\nThe Group designates the spot component of foreign forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk and applies\\\\na  hedge  ratio  of  1:1.  The  Group’s  policy  is  for  the  critical  terms  of  the  forward  exchange  contracts  to  align  with  the\\\\nhedged item. Based on the Group\\\\\\'s policy, the foreign currency risk relating to commercial transactions denominated\\\\nin a currency other than the functional currency of companies within the Group, is hedged between 25% and 80% of\\\\nthe transactional cash flows based on a rolling 12-month forecast, resulting in a relatively limited foreign exchange risk\\\\nfor non-hedged commercial transactions.\\\\n\\\\nCash flow hedge accounting is applied when the forecasted transaction is highly probable.\\\\n\\\\nGrandVision is exposed to the risk that the exchange rate related to its Argentinean operations will further devalue.\\\\nBecause the Argentinean peso-denominated assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the Argentinean operations are\\\\ntranslated into euros for consolidation purposes, a further devaluation of the Argentinean peso going forward could\\\\nresult in lower translated results, assets and liabilities in GrandVision’s consolidated figures, which are presented in\\\\neuros.  As  the  Argentinean  operations  represent  a  limited  part  of  the  Group,  the  effects  of  a  devaluation  would  be\\\\nlimited.\\\\n\\\\n(ii) Interest rate risk\\\\nThe Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. The\\\\nGroup generally borrows at variable rates and uses interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of future interest payments\\\\nbased on a rolling 12-month forecast, which have the economic effect of converting interest rates from floating rates to\\\\nfixed rates. The Group\\\\\\'s policy is to maintain a minimum of 60% of its net debt on a forward-looking 12-months basis,\\\\nrelated to interest rate risk at fixed rate. Under the interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange,\\\\nat  specified  intervals,  the  difference  between  fixed  contract  rates  and  floating  interest  rate  amounts  calculated  by\\\\nreference  to  the  agreed  notional  principal  amounts  and  benchmarks.  The  Group  also  uses  0%  floors  to  hedge  its\\\\nexposure to negative interest rate risk. The Group applies a hedge ratio of 1:1.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cThe table below shows sensitivity analysis considering changes in the EURIBOR:\\\\n\\\\n2020\\\\n\\\\n2019\\\\n\\\\nImpact on result\\\\nbefore tax\\\\n\\\\nImpact on Other\\\\nComprehensive\\\\nIncome\\\\n\\\\nImpact on result\\\\nbefore tax\\\\n\\\\nImpact on Other\\\\nComprehensive\\\\nIncome\\\\n\\\\nEURIBOR rate - increase 50 basis points\\\\n\\\\nEURIBOR rate - decrease 50 basis points\\\\n\\\\n-1,992\\\\n\\\\n1,789\\\\n\\\\n3,804\\\\n\\\\n-2,792\\\\n\\\\n- 2,281\\\\n\\\\n2,278\\\\n\\\\n5,979\\\\n\\\\n- 4,188\\\\n\\\\nNote 23 provides more detail on the derivatives the Group uses to hedge the cash flow interest rate risk.\\\\n\\\\n(iii) Price risk\\\\nManagement believes that the price risk is limited, because there are no listed securities held by the Group and the\\\\nGroup is not directly exposed to commodity price risk.\\\\n\\\\n3.1.2. Credit Risk\\\\nCredit  risk  is  managed  both  locally  and  on  a  Group  level,  where  applicable.  Credit  risk  arises  from  cash  and  cash\\\\nequivalents,  derivatives  and  deposits  with  banks  and  financial  institutions,  as  well  as  credit  exposures  to  wholesale\\\\ncustomers, retail customers, health insurance institutions and credit card companies, including outstanding receivables\\\\nand  committed  transactions.  Refer  to  note  16  for  details  of  expected  credit  losses  for  financial  assets  measured  at\\\\namortized cost.\\\\n\\\\nDerivative transactions are concluded, and cash and bank deposits are held only with financial institutions with strong\\\\ncredit ratings. The Group also diversifies its bank deposits and applies credit limits to each approved counterparty for\\\\nits derivatives. The Group has no significant concentrations of consumer credit risk as a result of the nature of its retail\\\\noperations. In addition, in some countries all or part of the consumer credit risk is transferred to credit card companies.\\\\nThe  Group  has  receivables  from  its  franchisees.  Management  believes  that  the  credit  risk  in  this  respect  is  limited,\\\\nbecause the franchisee receivables are often secured by pledges on the inventories of the franchisees. The utilization\\\\nof credit limits is regularly monitored. Sales to retail customers are settled in cash or using major debit and credit cards.\\\\n\\\\nIn view of the Brexit event, through 2019 and 2020 GrandVision proactively, together with its relationship UK domiciled\\\\nbanks,  have  taken  steps  to  ensure  that  these  banks  were  able  to  continue  providing  their  services.  In  addition,  the\\\\nGroup continued to adhere to a strict counterparty risk policy with defined limits per counterparty based on size and\\\\nexternal ratings, thereby effectively spreading the embedded counterparty risk in financial transactions over a number\\\\nof financial institutions.\\\\n\\\\n3.1.3. Liquidity Risk\\\\nPrudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding through an adequate\\\\namount  of  bilateral  credit  facilities  (immediately  available  funds),  a  commercial  paper  program  and  committed\\\\nmedium-term facilities (available at 4 days\\\\\\' notice). Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, the Group\\\\naims to have flexibility in funding by maintaining headroom of at least €200 million as a combination of cash at hand\\\\nplus available committed credit facilities minus any overdraft balances and/ or debt maturities with a term of less than\\\\none year. The Group and the local management monitors its liquidity periodically based on expected cash flows.\\\\n\\\\nThe  Group  has  a  committed  Revolving  Credit  Facility  (RCF)  of  €1,200  million  and  a  committed  additional  Liquidity\\\\nFacility (RLF) of €400 million, which will be available in the event that the RCF is fully drawn (see note 22). For both\\\\nfacilities  the  interest  rate  on  the  drawings  consists  of  a  margin  and  the  applicable  rate  (i.e.  for  a  loan  in  euros,  the\\\\nEURIBOR), however the applicable rate can never be below zero percent. RCF margin is, in addition, adjusted based on\\\\nthe sustainability performance of the Group.\\\\n\\\\nThe facilities share the same financial covenants. As at 31 December 2020, the Group was subject to a covenant holiday\\\\nand a new set of covenants will be applicable for the year 2021 (see note 3.2).\\\\n\\\\nThe  Group  has  a  commercial  paper  program  under  which  it  can  issue  commercial  paper  up  to  the  value  of\\\\n€500  million.  As  at  31  December  2020,  the  amount  outstanding  under  the  commercial  paper  program  was\\\\n€345 million (2019: €453 million).\\\\n\\\\n123\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cThe table below analyzes the maturity of the Group’s financial liabilities and derivative financial liabilities.

This program allows suppliers to receive payments early\\\\nfrom the bank, at their full discretion. Since the Group does not have a direct benefit, the payment terms of the Group\\\\nare not impacted by this scheme and there is no change to contractual relationship between the Group and the bank,\\\\nthe trade and other payable balances with suppliers participating in this program continue to be classified as trade and\\\\nother payable.\\\\n\\\\n3.2. Capital Risk Management\\\\nThe Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in\\\\norder  to  provide  returns  to  shareholders  and  benefits  to  other  stakeholders  and  to  maintain  an  optimal  capital\\\\nstructure to reduce the cost of capital.\\\\n\\\\nThe Group monitors capital based on leverage ratio (defined as net debt/EBITDA - covenants). Management believes\\\\nthe current capital structure, operational cash flows, and profitability of the Group will safeguard the Group’s ability to\\\\ncontinue  as  a  going  concern.  GrandVision  aims  to  maintain  a  maximum  leverage  ratio  of  2.0  (net  debt/EBITDA  -\\\\ncovenants) excluding the impact of any borrowings associated with, and any EBITDA amounts attributable to, major\\\\nacquisitions.  At  the  outset  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  Group  temporarily  shifted  focus  from  monitoring  capital\\\\nbased on the leverage ratio to securing the availability of financing to support the changing circumstances, including\\\\napplying for government support in various countries.\\\\n\\\\nNet  debt  consists  of  the  Group\\\\\\'s  borrowings,  derivatives  and  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  excluding  lease  liabilities.\\\\nEBITDA  used  for  monitoring  financial  covenants  is  calculated  as  adjusted  EBITDA  less  depreciation  of  right-of-use\\\\nassets and net financial result on lease liabilities and receivables (\\\\\\'EBITDA - covenants\\\\\\').\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of December 2020, GrandVision’s net debt position was €538,752 (2019: €752,708), with a leverage ratio of\\\\n1.3 (2019: 1.2). At 31 December 2020, a total of €325 million was drawn under the RCF (27% of the €1,200 million\\\\ncommitment)  with  the  remaining  debt  obtained  through  the  Commercial  Paper  market  of  €345  million,  and  other\\\\nshort-term facilities.\\\\n\\\\nIn June 2020, GrandVision entered into an additional Liquidity Facility (RLF) of €400 million. This RLF of €400 million,\\\\nwhich is provided by five of GrandVision’s relationship banks, will be available in the event that the RCF is fully drawn.\\\\nThe term is one year with an additional year available at GrandVision\\\\\\'s discretion.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, and as a result of the active dialogue with its relationship banks, GrandVision has reached an agreement to\\\\namend  its  existing  2019–2024  €1,200  million  Revolving  Credit  Facility  (RCF),  obtaining  a  relief  from  the  financial\\\\ncovenant tests in 2020. The next financial covenant test will be performed at amended terms at the end of Q1 2021,\\\\nand thereafter on amended terms at the end of each quarter in 2021. The new covenants provide the banking group\\\\nwith  sufficient  comfort  while  at  the  same  time  giving  GrandVision  operational  and  financial  flexibility  in  case  of\\\\nunexpected COVID-19 setbacks. Both facilities, RCF and RLF, share the same financial covenants. An overview of the\\\\ncovenants is as follows:\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cDate\\\\n\\\\n30 June 2020\\\\n\\\\n31 December 2020\\\\n\\\\n31 March 2021\\\\n\\\\n30 June 2021\\\\n\\\\n30 September 2021\\\\n\\\\n31 December 2021\\\\n\\\\nCovenants\\\\n\\\\nCovenant holiday\\\\n\\\\nCovenant holiday\\\\n\\\\nEBITDA - covenants of Q1 2021 above zero\\\\n\\\\nEBITDA - covenants of HY 2021 above €100 million and leverage ratio of 3.25x calculated as Net Debt to\\\\n4x 3 months preceding end Q2 2021 EBITDA - covenants\\\\n\\\\nleverage ratio of 3.25x calculated as Net Debt to 2x 6 months preceding end Q3 2021 EBITDA - covenants\\\\n\\\\nleverage ratio of 3.25x calculated as Net Debt to 2x 6 months preceding end Q4 2021 EBITDA –\\\\ncovenants\\\\n\\\\nAs of 2022, the financial covenants will revert to those defined in the RCF agreement covenant testing schedule.\\\\n\\\\nOn top of the above financial covenants, GrandVision will be providing a Liquidity Forecast to both bank groups on a\\\\nmonthly basis. Moreover, for as long as any loan is outstanding under the Additional Liquidity Facility, GrandVision shall\\\\nensure that the forecasted Liquidity (being the sum of Cash & Cash Equivalents and the undrawn available amounts\\\\nunder both the RCF and RLF) will be above €150 million at all times during each relevant 13-week forecast period.\\\\n\\\\n3.3. Fair Value Estimation\\\\nThe financial instruments carried at fair value can be valued using different levels of valuation methods. The different\\\\nlevels have been defined as follows:\\\\n\\\\n• Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1). A market is regarded as active\\\\nif quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service,\\\\nor  regulatory  agency,  and  those  prices  represent  actual  and  regularly  occurring  market  transactions  on  an  arm’s\\\\nlength basis.\\\\nInputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (prices)\\\\nor indirectly (derived from prices) (level 2).

Segments\\\\n\\\\nAn operating segment is defined as a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may\\\\nearn  revenues  and  incur  expenses,  whose  operating  results  are  regularly  reviewed  by  the  Group’s  chief  operating\\\\ndecision maker (‘CODM’) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment, assess its performance and\\\\nfor  which  discrete  financial  information  is  available.  The  CEO  and  CFO  (the  Management  Board)  forms  the  CODM.\\\\nOperating  segments  are  reported  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  internal  reporting  provided  to  the  CODM.  These\\\\noperating segments were defined based on geographic markets in line with their maturity, operating characteristics,\\\\nscale and market presence. The operating segments’ operating result is reviewed regularly by the Management Board –\\\\ntogether, the CODM – which makes decisions as to the resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their\\\\nperformance,  based  on  discrete  financial  information  available.  All  geographic  segments  are  involved  in  the  optical\\\\nretail industry, and there are no other significant product lines or sources of revenue for the Group.\\\\n\\\\nThere has been no aggregation of operating segments into reportable segments.\\\\n\\\\nThe Group’s reportable segments are defined as follows:\\\\n\\\\n• G4, consisting of the Netherlands & Belgium, the United Kingdom & Ireland, France, Monaco & Luxembourg and\\\\n\\\\nGermany & Austria\\\\n\\\\n• Other Europe, consisting of Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Italy,\\\\n\\\\nNorway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland\\\\n\\\\n• Americas  &  Asia,  consisting  of  Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile,  Colombia,  India,  Mexico,  Peru,  Russia,  Turkey,  the  United\\\\n\\\\nStates and Uruguay\\\\n\\\\nThe most important measures assessed by the CODM and used to make decisions about resources to be allocated are\\\\ntotal net revenue and adjusted EBITA. Measures of assets and liabilities by segment are not reported to the CODM.\\\\n\\\\nThe following table presents total net revenue and adjusted EBITA for the operating segments for 2020 and 2019. The\\\\nadjusted EBITA is defined as EBITA excluding non-recurring items. Non-recurring items are defined as significant items\\\\nthat  are  not  included  in  the  performance  of  the  segments  based  on  their  exceptional  nature.  For  2020  these  items\\\\namount to €63 million and include expenses related to impairments of fixed assets (€33 million), to the announced\\\\nacquisition of GrandVision shares by EssilorLuxottica (€23 million) and restructuring costs (€7 million). For 2019 these\\\\nitems  amount  to  €63  million  and  are  related  to  impairment  of  software  (€21  million),  expenses  related  to  the\\\\nannounced  acquisition  of  GrandVision  shares  by  EssilorLuxottica  (€9  million),  restructuring  costs  (€9  million),\\\\ndiscontinuation of activities in China (€4 million) and costs related to acquisitions and to prior year.

Revenue\\\\n\\\\nAccounting Policy\\\\nRevenue  from  contracts  with  customers  is  recognized  in  the  period  in  which  the  performance  obligation  in  the\\\\nunderlying  contract  has  been  satisfied.  In  most  sales  transactions  this  is  at  the  point  in  time  when  control  over  a\\\\nproduct or service has been transferred to the customer. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, expected returns,\\\\nrebates,  discounts  and  amounts  collected  on  behalf  of  third  parties.  Intercompany  revenues  within  the  Group  are\\\\neliminated.\\\\n\\\\nA contract with a customer may comprise of multiple distinct performance obligations. The total consideration under\\\\nthe contract is allocated to performance obligations based on standalone selling prices. The standalone selling price of\\\\nproducts  sold  is  determined  based  on  the  retail  price.  For  other  performance  obligations,  experience  is  used  to\\\\nestimate standalone selling prices. The timing of revenue recognition depends on the type of performance obligation,\\\\nas described below.\\\\n\\\\nOptical product revenues, including optical subscription arrangements, are recognized when the product is sold to the\\\\ncustomer and control over the product has been transferred to the customer in return for a (right to) payment or series\\\\nof monthly payments. Revenue generally is recognized on the moment of the delivery of the product to the customer. In\\\\ncase of optical subscription arrangements, the revenue for the right of use of spectacles is determined based on the\\\\npayments  to  be  received  until  end  of  the  contract  and  recognized  at  the  time  of  the  sale.  Any  prepayments  by\\\\ncustomers are short-term in nature and are not considered revenue but are accounted for as contract liabilities.\\\\n\\\\nIncome  from  optical  products  related  services,  including  extended  (service-type)  warranties  and  commissions  on\\\\nconsumer insurances,  is  recognized  based  upon  the  duration  of  the  underlying  contracts,  over a  period of  12  or  24\\\\nmonths. Extended warranties are considered services to be rendered and therefore a distinct performance obligation\\\\nand included under contract liabilities until revenue is recognized. The Group’s obligation to repair or replace faulty\\\\nproducts under the standard warranty terms is recognized as a provision.\\\\n\\\\nRights issued under a customer loyalty program through vouchers for rebates on future purchases are considered a\\\\nseparate performance obligation and a contract liability is recognized as a reduction to revenue. The standalone selling\\\\nprice of the vouchers is estimated using past experience and the likelihood of redemption. Revenue allocated to the\\\\nvouchers is recognized based on (anticipated) expiration and when the vouchers are redeemed, generally less than 12\\\\nmonths.\\\\n\\\\nFor sales to franchisees and wholesale partners, revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer, when the risks of\\\\nobsolescence and loss have been transferred to and the products have been accepted by the customer.\\\\n\\\\nFranchise rights are accounted for as rights to access the franchisor’s intellectual property. Franchise royalties that are\\\\nbased on a percentage of sales are recognized at the time of the sale. Contributions from franchisees are generally\\\\nrecognized based upon the duration of the contractually agreed-upon term.\\\\n\\\\nRevenue is reduced and a refund liability is recognized where the customer has a right to return a product in which the\\\\ntransaction price is refunded. A return asset is recognized and cost of sales is reduced where returns can be resold.\\\\nExperience is used to estimate such returns at the time of sale.\\\\n\\\\nSupplier  allowances  are  only  recognized  as  revenue  if  there  is  no  direct  relationship  with  a  purchase  transaction,\\\\notherwise the supplier allowance is deducted from cost of these purchases.\\\\n\\\\nA  receivable  is  recognized  when  all  performance  obligations  in  the  contract  have  been  satisfied  and  payment  has\\\\nbecome unconditional.\\\\n\\\\n128\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cDisaggregation of revenue\\\\n\\\\nSet out below is the disaggregation of the Group’s revenue from contracts with customers per reportable segment in\\\\n2020 and 2019, respectively.\\\\n\\\\nFranchise revenues include sales to franchisees and franchise royalties and contributions.

Tax  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated  Income\\\\nStatement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in Other Comprehensive Income or directly in equity.\\\\nIn the latter case, the related tax is recognized in Other Comprehensive Income or directly in equity.\\\\n\\\\nThe  current  income  tax  charge  is  calculated  based on  the  tax  laws  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at  the  balance\\\\nsheet  date  in  the  countries  where  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  operate  and  generate  taxable  income.\\\\nManagement  periodically  evaluates  positions  taken  in  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which  applicable  tax\\\\nregulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate based on amounts expected to be\\\\npaid  to  the  tax  authorities  and  reflects  uncertainty  related  to  income  taxes,  if  any.  If  the  Group  concluded  it  is  not\\\\nprobable that the tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the Group determines the tax impact, applying\\\\nthe \\\\\\'most likely amount\\\\\\' or \\\\\\' the expected value\\\\\\' methods, depending on circumstances and expected resolution of the\\\\nuncertainty.\\\\n\\\\nDeferred income tax is recognized, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases\\\\nof  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the  Balance  Sheet.  However,  deferred  tax  liabilities  are  not\\\\nrecognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and\\\\nlaws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the\\\\nrelated deferred income tax asset is realized, or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\\\\n\\\\nDeferred income tax assets are recognized for losses carried forward and unused incentive tax credits to the extent that\\\\nsufficient  taxable  temporary  differences  and  deductible  temporary  differences  are  available  or  realization  of  the\\\\nrelated  tax  benefit  through  the  future  taxable  profits  is  probable.  The  assessment  of  whether  a  deferred  tax  asset\\\\nshould  be  recognized  based  on  the  availability  of  future  taxable  profits  take  into  account  all  factors  concerning  the\\\\nentity\\\\\\'s expected future profitability, both favorable and unfavorable.\\\\n\\\\nDeferred income tax is recognized on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and\\\\njoint ventures, except for deferred income tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is\\\\ncontrolled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\\\\n\\\\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets\\\\nagainst current tax liabilities, and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by\\\\nthe same taxation authority, on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities, where there is an intention\\\\nto settle the balances on a net basis.\\\\n\\\\n133\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cSignificant Accounting Estimates and Judgments\\\\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the\\\\ntotal provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination\\\\nis  uncertain  during  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  Certain  uncertainties  are  caused  by  the  many  changes  in\\\\ninternational  tax  policies,  in  absence  of  available  guidance  and  caselaw  on  those  recent  or  newly  enacted  tax\\\\nmeasures.\\\\n\\\\nThe Group recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be\\\\ndue.  Where  the  final  tax  outcome  of  these  matters  is  different  from  the  amounts  that  were  initially  recorded,  such\\\\ndifferences  will  impact  the  current  and  deferred  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities  in  the  period  for  which  such\\\\ndetermination is made.\\\\n\\\\nCarry forward losses and unused incentive tax credits are recognized as a deferred tax asset to the extent that sufficient\\\\ntaxable temporary differences are available or if it is likely that future taxable profits will be available against which\\\\nlosses  can  be  set  off.  Judgment  is  involved  to  establish  the  extent  to  which  expected  future  profits  substantiate  the\\\\nrecognition of a carry forward loss.\\\\n\\\\nIncome Taxes\\\\n\\\\n134\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\nThe following income tax was recognized in consolidated Income Statement:\\\\n\\\\nin thousands of EUR\\\\n\\\\nCurrent income tax\\\\n\\\\nDeferred income tax\\\\n\\\\nCharge in Income Statement\\\\n\\\\n2020\\\\n\\\\n58,247\\\\n\\\\n- 4,293\\\\n\\\\n53,954\\\\n\\\\n2019\\\\n\\\\n100,361\\\\n\\\\n-21,184\\\\n\\\\n79,177\\\\n\\\\nThe reconciliation between the computed weighted average rate of income tax expense, which is generally applicable\\\\nto GrandVision companies, and the actual rate of taxation is as follows:\\\\n\\\\nin thousands of EUR\\\\n\\\\nResult before tax\\\\n\\\\nComputed weighted average tax rate*\\\\n\\\\nNet exempt expenses not deductible for tax purposes\\\\n\\\\nIncentive tax credits for the reporting period\\\\n\\\\nNet effect of (de)recognition of tax losses and unused incentive tax credits\\\\n\\\\nChanges in tax rate\\\\n\\\\nImpairment of deferred tax asset\\\\n\\\\n(Over)/Under provided in prior years\\\\n\\\\nTax charge\\\\n\\\\n2020\\\\n\\\\n9,232\\\\n\\\\n12,545\\\\n\\\\n18,610\\\\n\\\\n- 2,860\\\\n\\\\n12,666\\\\n\\\\n1,927\\\\n\\\\n7,250\\\\n\\\\n3,816\\\\n\\\\n%\\\\n\\\\n100.0%\\\\n\\\\n136.0%\\\\n\\\\n201.6%\\\\n\\\\n-31.0%\\\\n\\\\n137.2%\\\\n\\\\n20.9%\\\\n\\\\n78.5%\\\\n\\\\n41.3%\\\\n\\\\n53,954\\\\n\\\\n584.5%\\\\n\\\\n2019\\\\n\\\\n%\\\\n\\\\n274,548\\\\n\\\\n100.0%\\\\n\\\\n86,098\\\\n\\\\n17,654\\\\n\\\\n-3,097\\\\n\\\\n-6,714\\\\n\\\\n-601\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n-14,163\\\\n\\\\n79,177\\\\n\\\\n31.5%\\\\n\\\\n6.4%\\\\n\\\\n-1.1%\\\\n\\\\n-2.4%\\\\n\\\\n-0.2%\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n-5.2%\\\\n\\\\n28.9%\\\\n\\\\n*This is calculated based on the different weights of the results in different countries and their domestic tax rates.\\\\n\\\\nExpenses not deductible for tax purposes in 2020 include €11,420 related to impairment of goodwill in CGU United\\\\nStates and CGU Italy (2019: €10,739 impairment of goodwill in CGU United States).

Leases\\\\n\\\\nAccounting policy\\\\n\\\\nDefinition of a lease\\\\n\\\\nThe lease contracts relate mainly to the lease of the Group\\\\\\'s own stores and leases for stores that are subleased to the\\\\nGroup\\\\\\'s franchisees. Lease contracts also include leases for offices, warehouses, vehicles and equipment.\\\\n\\\\nAt the inception date of the contract, GrandVision assesses if it has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic\\\\nbenefits from use of the leased asset throughout the period of use in exchange for consideration; and if it can direct\\\\nhow the leased asset is used.\\\\n\\\\nThe following contracts are not considered to be a lease and shall be expensed to the consolidated Income Statement\\\\nwhen incurred:\\\\n\\\\n• The contracts with rent payments, which are based on variables such as revenue, volume or traffic levels.\\\\n• When a lessor has a substantive substitution right, for example the landlord can benefit by moving the store/corner\\\\nor  office  during  the  lease  contract,  with  only  limited  costs  or  efforts  of  the  landlord,  while  GrandVision  cannot\\\\nprevent the landlord from moving the store.\\\\n\\\\nLessee Accounting\\\\n\\\\nAt  the  lease  commencement  date  GrandVision  recognizes  a  right-of-use  asset  and  a  lease  liability.  The  right-of-use\\\\nasset  is  initially  measured  at  cost,  which  comprises  the  initial  amount  of  the  lease  liability  adjusted  for  any  lease\\\\npayments made at or before the commencement date, plus key money paid when entering the lease and any other\\\\nincremental costs of obtaining the lease.\\\\n\\\\nSubsequently  the  cost  of  a  right-of-use  asset  is  depreciated  using  the  straight-line  basis  to  reduce  the  right-of-use\\\\nasset\\\\\\'s  carrying  value  to  its  residual  value  over  the  shorter  of  its  estimated  useful  life  and  the  lease  term  (see  also\\\\nparagraph \\\\\\'Significant accounting estimates and judgments\\\\\\'). Right-of-use assets are adjusted for remeasurements of\\\\nlease  liabilities.  Right-of-use  assets  are  subject  to  a  regular  impairment  assessment.  A  triggering  event  analysis  for\\\\nimpairment of right-of-use assets is performed on a store and chain level. For annual impairment test purposes right-\\\\nof-use assets are included in the carrying amount of relevant CGU, which represents a country or group of countries.\\\\n\\\\nThe residual value of right-of-use asset is assumed to be zero, except for initial costs Droit au Bail in France as these\\\\ncosts relate to the right to lease, which can be sold at the end of the lease term. These costs are treated as a separate\\\\ncomponent. The residual value is reviewed on a regular basis. The fair value is determined by external valuators taking\\\\ninto  account  cost  per  square  meter  and  latest  similar  transactions  for  the  main  shopping  malls,  which  are  publicly\\\\navailable. Changes in the residual value are recognized in the consolidated Income Statement.\\\\n\\\\nThe  lease  liability  is  initially  measured  at  the  present  value  of  outstanding  lease  payments  during  the  lease  term,\\\\ndiscounted  using  the  incremental  borrowing  rate  (see  also  paragraph  \\\\\\'Significant  accounting  estimates  and\\\\njudgments\\\\\\'). The Group has elected to include both lease and non-lease components (e.g. fixed service costs) to the\\\\namount of lease liability.\\\\n\\\\nThe lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method and is remeasured\\\\nwhen  there  is  a  change  in  future  lease  payments  arising,  for  example,  from  renegotiations  of  the  lease  contract,  a\\\\nchange  in  an  index,  or  if  GrandVision  changes  its  assessment  of  whether  it  will  exercise  extension  or  termination\\\\noptions (see also paragraph \\\\\\'Significant accounting estimates and judgments\\\\\\'). When the lease liability is remeasured,\\\\na corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, unless a change in accounting\\\\npolicy as from 2020, related to COVID-19 rent reduction, is applicable. If as a result of this remeasurement, there is any\\\\nexcess over the carrying amount of the asset, it is recognized in the consolidated Income Statement within occupancy\\\\ncosts.\\\\n\\\\nAt  the  end  of  the  lease  term  or  at  early  termination  of  the  lease,  the  cost  of  the  right-of-use  asset,  accumulated\\\\ndepreciation, and outstanding lease liability, are written-down with the difference, if any, recorded in the consolidated\\\\nIncome statement within other occupancy costs.\\\\n\\\\nCOVID-19 rent reduction\\\\n\\\\nA COVID-19 rent reduction shall meet all of the following criteria: (a) the change in lease payments does not result in a\\\\nhigher consideration; (b) only lease payments in 2020 and not later than 30 June 2021 are reduced; and (c) there are no\\\\n\\\\n139\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0csubstantial changes to other terms and conditions of the lease (see also paragraph in \\\\\\'Significant accounting estimates\\\\nand judgments\\\\\\'). GrandVision elected to apply the practical expedient to all the rent concessions, which meet these\\\\ncriteria and treated a COVID-19 rent reduction as a negative variable lease payment. The amount of this rent reduction\\\\nis recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement as a part of occupancy costs.\\\\n\\\\nShort-term and low-value leases\\\\n\\\\nThe Group has elected that the lease payments associated with lease contracts with a term of 12 months or less and\\\\nleases  of  low-value  assets  (individual  value  of  below  €5,000,  when  new,  such  as  computer  equipment  or  mobile\\\\nphones) are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\\\n\\\\nLessor accounting\\\\n\\\\nThe Group subleases some of its right-of-use assets to franchisees or other third parties. When substantially all the risks\\\\nand rewards transfer to the lessee, the sublease is classified as finance lease, otherwise the sub-lease is an operating\\\\nlease.\\\\n\\\\nWhen the sublease is classified as finance lease, the right-of-use asset in the head lease is de-recognized and a lease\\\\nreceivable is recognized. The lease receivable is initially measured at the present value of future lease receipts, which\\\\ninclude both lease and non-lease components. Any difference on initial recognition of finance sublease is recorded in\\\\nthe consolidated Income statement within occupancy costs. Subsequently, the interest income and interest expense\\\\nare accrued on the lease receivable and lease liability respectively applying the effective interest method.\\\\n\\\\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Judgments\\\\n\\\\nLease term\\\\n\\\\nThe lease term comprises the non-cancellable period of a lease contract, plus periods covered by a reasonably certain\\\\nrenewal  option  and  periods  covered  by  a  termination  option,  which  are  not  reasonably  certain  to  be  exercised.\\\\nGrandVision  assesses  whether  it  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise  renewal  and  termination  options  at  lease\\\\ncommencement date and subsequently, if there is a change in circumstances. When determining the lease term only\\\\nthe options within control of GrandVision are considered.\\\\n\\\\nWhen assessing renewal and termination options related to real estate leases, a distinction is made between new and\\\\nexisting locations, as well as between the stores based on their performance.\\\\n\\\\nThe lease term for a new store is the longest of the non-cancellable period with a minimum of 3 years. In addition, the\\\\nGroup considers the other circumstances, including recent leasehold improvements, local legislation, chain strategy,\\\\netc. and then decides if a different period is more appropriate.\\\\n\\\\nTowards the end of the lease term the probability of exercising renewal or termination options is reconsidered based\\\\non  business  strategy,  performance  of  the  store  and  other  considerations.  In  general,  options  are  considered  to  be\\\\nreasonably certain at the moment when the landlord is notified about the extension or termination. In case the contract\\\\nhas automatic renewal options, the remaining lease term is equal to the shortest possible extension of the lease, but is\\\\nnot less than 5 years for high performing stores or not less than 3 years for other stores.\\\\n\\\\nThe  Group  is  reasonably  certain  not  to  exercise  a  termination  option  if  the  term  with  possible  termination  would\\\\nbecome less than 5 years for high performing stores or less than 3 years for other stores.\\\\n\\\\nThe periods of 5 years for high performing stores and 3 years for new and other stores is determined considering Group\\\\npractice  and  experience,  developments  in  (optical)  retail  markets,  real  estate  rental  markets,  regulations,  economic\\\\nenvironment and technology. These estimates are reassessed periodically. \\\\n\\\\nDiscount rate\\\\n\\\\nThe  Group  uses  incremental  borrowing  rates  (IBRs)  as  a  discount  rate,  since  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease\\\\ncontract generally cannot be readily determined for most of the leases in lease portfolio of the Group. The IBR is the\\\\nrate that a lessee would pay to attract required funding to purchase the asset over a similar term, with a similar security\\\\nand  in  a  similar  economic  environment.  In  determining  the  IBR,  the  comparable  uncontrolled  price  method  was\\\\nselected. The IBR is determined as the sum of a reference rate, credit risk premium and sovereign risk premium. The\\\\nsovereign risk premium is based on the Credit Default Swaps’ market.\\\\n\\\\n140\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cThe calculation of IBR takes into account the currency of the lease contract, the lease term, type of leased assets, the\\\\ncountry of the lessee and the credit rating of the lessee. The credit rating of the lessee is determined based on financial\\\\nassessment, in which a scoring approach is applied to key financial ratios of the lessee.\\\\n\\\\nThe IBRs are determined on a country-by-country basis with a distinction between the currency of the lease contract, as\\\\nwell as lease term. A single IBR is applied to a portfolio of leases, which are similar in nature and in lease term within a\\\\ncountry.\\\\n\\\\nCOVID-19 rent reduction: substantial change\\\\n\\\\nCOVID-19 rent concession is not eligible for the practical expedient if there is a substantial change in lease terms. To be\\\\nconsidered substantial, at least one of the following criteria is met: (a) there is a change of the scope of the lease; (b)\\\\nthere is a change in a lease term.\\\\n\\\\nThe movements in the right-of -use assets are as follows:\\\\n\\\\nin thousands of EUR\\\\n\\\\nAt 1 January 2019\\\\n\\\\nCost\\\\n\\\\nAccumulated depreciation and impairment\\\\n\\\\nCarrying amount\\\\n\\\\nMovements\\\\n\\\\nAcquisitions\\\\n\\\\nAdditions\\\\n\\\\nReassessment/modification\\\\n\\\\nDisposal\\\\n\\\\nDepreciation charge\\\\n\\\\nImpairment\\\\n\\\\nExchange differences\\\\n\\\\nAt 31 December 2019\\\\n\\\\nAt 1 January 2020\\\\n\\\\nCost\\\\n\\\\nAccumulated depreciation and impairment\\\\n\\\\nCarrying amount\\\\n\\\\nMovements\\\\n\\\\nAcquisitions\\\\n\\\\nAdditions\\\\n\\\\nReassessment/modification\\\\n\\\\nDisposal\\\\n\\\\nDepreciation charge\\\\n\\\\nImpairment\\\\n\\\\nExchange differences\\\\n\\\\nAt 31 December 2020\\\\n\\\\nCost\\\\n\\\\nAccumulated depreciation and impairment\\\\n\\\\nCarrying amount\\\\n\\\\nNotes\\\\n\\\\nBuildings\\\\n\\\\n1,385,118\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n1,385,118\\\\n\\\\n23,212\\\\n\\\\n119,372\\\\n\\\\n251,054\\\\n\\\\n- 846\\\\n\\\\n- 349,818\\\\n\\\\n- 5,695\\\\n\\\\n12,366\\\\n\\\\n1,434,763\\\\n\\\\n1,778,412\\\\n\\\\n- 343,649\\\\n\\\\n1,434,763\\\\n\\\\n324\\\\n\\\\n58,235\\\\n\\\\n230,872\\\\n\\\\n- 88\\\\n\\\\n-347,767\\\\n\\\\n-24,234\\\\n\\\\n-37,845\\\\n\\\\n1,314,260\\\\n\\\\n1,985,803\\\\n\\\\n- 671,543\\\\n\\\\n1,314,260\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\n\\\\nOther\\\\n\\\\n8,430\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n8,430\\\\n\\\\n66\\\\n\\\\n4,506\\\\n\\\\n97\\\\n\\\\n- 2\\\\n\\\\n- 4,936\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n30\\\\n\\\\n8,191\\\\n\\\\n12,117\\\\n\\\\n- 3,926\\\\n\\\\n8,191\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n4,305\\\\n\\\\n1,041\\\\n\\\\n- 30\\\\n\\\\n-4,817\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n-335\\\\n\\\\n8,355\\\\n\\\\n14,537\\\\n\\\\n- 6,182\\\\n\\\\n8,355\\\\n\\\\nTotal\\\\n\\\\n1,393,548\\\\n\\\\n141\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n1,393,548\\\\n\\\\n23,278\\\\n\\\\n123,878\\\\n\\\\n251,151\\\\n\\\\n- 848\\\\n\\\\n- 354,754\\\\n\\\\n- 5,695\\\\n\\\\n12,396\\\\n\\\\n1,442,954\\\\n\\\\n1,790,529\\\\n\\\\n- 347,575\\\\n\\\\n1,442,954\\\\n\\\\n324\\\\n\\\\n62,540\\\\n\\\\n231,913\\\\n\\\\n- 118\\\\n\\\\n- 352,584\\\\n\\\\n- 24,234\\\\n\\\\n- 38,180\\\\n\\\\n1,322,615\\\\n\\\\n2,000,340\\\\n\\\\n- 677,725\\\\n\\\\n1,322,615\\\\n\\\\nThe  impairment  loss  in  2020  represents  the  write-down  of  the  Right-of-use  assets  mainly  in  the  Americas  &  Asia\\\\nsegment,  following  an  impairment  assessment  performed  in  June  2020  for  the  chains  with  historically  low\\\\nperformance, and following restructuring.

Each of those groups of cash-generating units represents the Group’s investment in a\\\\ncountry or group of countries, which is the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored for management purposes.\\\\n\\\\nIf  a  cash-generating  unit  is  divested,  the  carrying  amount  of  its  goodwill  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated  Income\\\\nStatement. If the divestment concerns part of cash-generating units, the amount of goodwill written off and recognized\\\\nin the consolidated Income Statement is determined based on the relative value of the part divested compared to the\\\\nvalue  of  the  group  of  cash-generating  units.  Goodwill  directly  attributable  to  the  divested  unit  is  written  off  and\\\\nrecognized in the consolidated Income Statement.\\\\n\\\\nGoodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment testing.\\\\n\\\\nImpairment Test of Non-amortized Assets\\\\n\\\\nAssets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for impairment. Assets\\\\nthat are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\\\\nthat the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\\\\n\\\\nAn impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.\\\\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of the value-in-use and the fair value less costs of disposal.\\\\n\\\\nValue-in-use is calculated using the discounted cash flow method based on the asset’s continuing use and applying a\\\\npre-tax  discount  rate  derived  from  the  average  cost  of  capital.  If  a  CGU  does  not  pass  the  value-in-use  test,  the\\\\nrecoverable amount will be calculated with fair value less costs of disposal method.\\\\n\\\\nFair  value  less  costs  of  disposal  model  is  based  on  the  CGU\\\\\\'s  highest  and  best  use  from  a  market  participant\\\\\\'s\\\\nperspective as far as they can be reasonably ascertained, taking financial plans as approved by management as a base\\\\n(level 3). These estimates include potential business expansion and reorganizations, if applicable. This model is based\\\\non a post-tax calculation, using a post-tax discount rate. Fair value less costs of disposal model can be based on the\\\\ndiscounted cash flows method or sales multiple.\\\\n\\\\nImpairments  are  recognized  in  the  consolidated  Income  Statement.  Impairment  recognized  in  respect  of  cash-\\\\ngenerating units is first allocated to goodwill and then to other assets of the cash-generating unit on a pro-rata basis\\\\nbased on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash-generating unit. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0csuffered  impairment  are  reviewed  for  possible  reversal  of  the  impairment  at  each  reporting  date.  impairment  of\\\\ngoodwill, recognized in previous interim or annual period, cannot be reversed.\\\\n\\\\n144\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Judgments\\\\n\\\\nThe Group performs its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter and an additional goodwill impairment\\\\ntest is performed during the year when there is a triggering event.\\\\n\\\\nDue to the temporary store closures in most of the countries of the Group in the second quarter of 2020, following the\\\\npandemic  outbreak  the  Group  performed  the  following  analysis  to  identify  CGU\\\\\\'s  with  a  triggering  event:  (a)\\\\nassessment of the impact of the pandemic on the market and expected recovery of the operations in the region; (b)\\\\nextent and duration of the local government assistance to support the business. Apart from that analysis, when the\\\\nrecoverable amount as per 2019 Annual impairment test was significantly greater than the carrying amount of the CGU\\\\nand/or was not sensitive to changes in key assumptions, the Group did not re-estimate the recoverable amount of the\\\\nrelevant  CGU.  As  a  result,  the  following  seven  CGUs  were  tested  for  impairment:  United  Kingdom  &  Ireland  (G4\\\\nsegment); Switzerland, Italy (Other Europe segment); United States, Chile & Uruguay, Colombia, and Peru (Americas &\\\\nAsia segment).\\\\n\\\\nImpact of COVID-19 on impairment test models in 2020\\\\n\\\\nDuring  the  year,  to  reflect  the  uncertainties  of  the  pandemic,  the  Group  changed  its  valuation  technique  used  to\\\\nestimate  the  recoverable  amount  for  the  value-in-use  from  the  traditional  approach,  which  uses  a  single  cash  flow\\\\nscenario, to the expected cash flow approach. This approach is based on different scenarios depending on the recovery\\\\nof the business to the pre-pandemic level. The discounted cash flow projections in each scenario of the value-in-use\\\\nmodel  cover  a  period  of  five  years  and  include  the  effects  of  restructuring  plans  and  benefits  of  the  government\\\\nassistance, as committed at the end of the reporting period, where applicable. Cash flows beyond the five-year period\\\\nwere extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of nil. The discount rates do not reflect uncertainty risks, for which\\\\nthe estimated cash flows have been adjusted.\\\\n\\\\nScenarios in the impairment test in the second quarter of 2020\\\\n\\\\nFive scenarios were developed , including two V-shaped rebounds with recovery of the business to the pre-pandemic\\\\nlevel (\\\\\\'recovery point\\\\\\') in the next 6 and 12 months (Scenarios V1 and V2, respectively); U-shaped with recovery in the\\\\nnext 24 months (Scenario U); and two L-shaped scenarios, in which the optical market in the country goes into longer\\\\nrecession and stays below the pre-pandemic trend (Scenario L1 and L2).\\\\n\\\\nThe EBITA and revenue growth rates in the second half of 2020 were based on the latest ramp-up plans as approved by\\\\nthe management in June 2020. The revenue growth rate and EBITA after recovery point were based on the financial\\\\nplans as approved by management before pandemic at the end of 2019 with a respective postponement of the Group\\\\nstrategy  and  adjusted  for  the  COVID-19  impact  as  follows:  (a)  all  the  scenarios  include  costs  for  the  COVID-19\\\\npreventive measures in the stores at 0.85 % of sales in year 1; (b) for the L-shaped scenarios potential negative impact\\\\nof a change in the future customer behavior and preferences, as well as additional COVID-19 related costs, are added\\\\nto  the  projections  of  the  U-shaped  scenario.  Management  has  subjectively  assigned  probability  weights  to  each\\\\nscenario based on business development during the ramp-up period and its expectations for the eyewear industry in a\\\\nspecific country following the pandemic:\\\\n\\\\nUnited Kingdom & Ireland, Switzerland, Italy\\\\n\\\\nUS\\\\n\\\\nChile & Uruguay, Colombia, and Peru\\\\n\\\\n5%\\\\n\\\\n5%\\\\n\\\\n5%\\\\n\\\\n50%\\\\n\\\\n30%\\\\n\\\\n5%\\\\n\\\\n25%\\\\n\\\\n50%\\\\n\\\\n25%\\\\n\\\\n15%\\\\n\\\\n10%\\\\n\\\\n35%\\\\n\\\\n5%\\\\n\\\\n5%\\\\n\\\\n30%\\\\n\\\\nScenario V1\\\\n\\\\nScenario V2\\\\n\\\\nScenario U\\\\n\\\\nScenario L1\\\\n\\\\nScenario L2\\\\n\\\\nScenarios in the 2020 annual impairment test\\\\n\\\\nSince  2020  the  annual  goodwill  impairment  test  was  performed  in  the  fourth  quarter,  it  was  based  on  the  updated\\\\nfinancial plans, which included the COVID-19 implications for the business. Since in the end of the year, the uncertainty\\\\nabout the impact of the pandemic outbreak on the industry was relatively lower, compared to second quarter, there\\\\nwere only 3 scenarios developed for the annual impairment test. These scenarios included base scenario (Scenario U1),\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cwhich was based on the financial plans as approved by management in 2020, including the assumption that the year\\\\n2021 will be on the level of 2019; optimistic scenario (Scenario U2) which included improvement compared to the base\\\\nscenario in terms of higher profitability by 2% of sales in each year; W-shaped scenario (Scenario W), which included\\\\nfuture  \\\\\\'waves\\\\\\'  of  the  pandemic  in  year  1  and  recovery  of  the  business  with  one  year  delay,  compared  to  the  base\\\\nscenario. The revenue growth and EBITA were based on the approved latest budget for the next five years. The EBITA\\\\npercentage  incorporated  changes  due  to  the  pandemic,  including  additional  costs  for  the  COVID-19  preventive\\\\nmeasures in the stores as well as improvements due to expected change in customer behavior and preferences.\\\\n\\\\nManagement believes that the probability weights below represent a reasonable assessment of the likelihood of the\\\\nscenarios,  taking  into  account  that  the  most-likely  base  scenarios  already  include  a  country-specific  impact  of  the\\\\npandemic on the expectations for the eyewear industry:\\\\n\\\\nG4\\\\n\\\\nOther Europe\\\\n\\\\nAmericas & Asia\\\\n\\\\nKey assumptions and judgments for value-in-use\\\\n\\\\nScenario U1\\\\n\\\\nScenario U2\\\\n\\\\nScenario W\\\\n\\\\n70%\\\\n\\\\n70%\\\\n\\\\n70%\\\\n\\\\n10%\\\\n\\\\n10%\\\\n\\\\n5%\\\\n\\\\n20%\\\\n\\\\n20%\\\\n\\\\n25%\\\\n\\\\nThe value-in-use model based on discounted cash flow method requires management to apply judgements around\\\\nrevenue growth, profit assumptions and the discount rate.\\\\n\\\\n145\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\nAll  assumptions  are  weighted  based  on  the  relevant  scenarios.

For\\\\nemerging markets, a sales multiple is used to determine fair value less cost of disposal. The Group applies a multiple to\\\\nthe average sales of the last three full calendar years. The sales multiple is based on the recent market transactions and\\\\npeers of the Group, considering risk factors of the CGU, for which the fair value less costs of disposal is calculated. For\\\\nrecently acquired cash-generating units and cash-generating units with large investments in store openings to generate\\\\ngrowth, the average sales of the last three years are adjusted to reflect these developments.\\\\n\\\\nIn  2020,  following  implementation  of  IFRS  16,  right-of-use  assets  are  included  in  the  carrying  amount,  which  have\\\\nnegative impact on the headroom. To compensate this impact sales multiples are adjusted accordingly. Uncertainty\\\\naround  the  impact  of  the  pandemic  is  reflected  by  a  reduction  of  the  sales  multiple  in  line  with  a  country-specific\\\\nimpact of the pandemic on the expectations for the eyewear industry.\\\\n\\\\nSales multiples are used to determine the recoverable amount for the CGU Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Peru and\\\\nare as shown below:\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cAmericas & Asia\\\\n\\\\n0.8 - 0.9\\\\n\\\\n0.9 - 1.0\\\\n\\\\n1 – 1.2\\\\n\\\\n2020 Annual impairment\\\\ntest\\\\n\\\\nImpairment test in Q2 2020\\\\n(only CGUs with triggering\\\\nevents)\\\\n\\\\n2019 Annual impairment\\\\ntest\\\\n\\\\nMovements in goodwill are as follow:\\\\n\\\\nin thousands of EUR\\\\n\\\\nAt 1 January\\\\n\\\\nAcquisitions\\\\n\\\\nImpairment\\\\n\\\\nExchange differences\\\\n\\\\nAt 31 December\\\\n\\\\nCosts\\\\n\\\\nAccumulated impairment\\\\n\\\\n146\\\\n\\\\nCarrying amount\\\\n\\\\nNotes\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\n\\\\n2020\\\\n\\\\n1,146,028\\\\n\\\\n4,882\\\\n\\\\n- 73,136\\\\n\\\\n- 17,261\\\\n\\\\n2019\\\\n\\\\n1,084,908\\\\n\\\\n99,802\\\\n\\\\n- 51,138\\\\n\\\\n12,456\\\\n\\\\n1,060,513\\\\n\\\\n1,146,028\\\\n\\\\n1,269,780\\\\n\\\\n- 209,267\\\\n\\\\n1,060,513\\\\n\\\\n1,293,756\\\\n\\\\n- 147,728\\\\n\\\\n1,146,028\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\nThe  impairment  charge  recognized  in  June  2020,  relates  to  an  impairment  of  goodwill  in  the  CGUs  United  States,\\\\nColombia and Peru, which operate in the Americas & Asia segment and in the CGU Italy, which operates in the Other\\\\nEurope segment.

The CGU of the Netherlands &\\\\nBelgium is at the higher end of the average EBITA percentage range with the CGUs of France and Germany & Austria\\\\nclosely following. The lower end of the EBITA range relates to the CGU of the United Kingdom & Ireland. The higher end\\\\nof  the  pre-tax  discount  rate  range  relates  to  the  CGU  of  France  while  the  lower  end  relates  to  the  CGUs  of  the\\\\nNetherlands .\\\\n\\\\nIn recent years, significant efforts have been made to ensure the business was prepared for any given Brexit outcome,\\\\nwhether there was a deal or not, including development of IT systems to support timely shipment of goods. In 2020, the\\\\nGroup considered and incorporated the impact on the assumptions resulting from Brexit in its goodwill impairment\\\\ntest. The strategic plan for the CGU of the United Kingdom & Ireland includes expected implications of higher import\\\\nduties and the costs relating to customs clearance administration and bureaucracy.\\\\n\\\\nThe carrying value of goodwill allocated to the CGU of France of €211,175 (2019: €211,175) is considered significant in\\\\nrelation to the Group\\\\\\'s total carrying value of goodwill. A reasonably possible change to key assumptions used in the\\\\nvalue-in-use  would  not  result  in  a  material  impairment  of  goodwill  for  CGU  of  France,  as  this  method  indicated\\\\nsufficient  headroom.  The  approach  for  determining  key  assumptions  for  CGU  France  is  consistent  with  the  Group\\\\\\'s\\\\napproach described above.\\\\n\\\\nOther Europe segment\\\\n\\\\nIn 2020, the higher end of the average revenue growth rate range mainly relates to the CGU of Poland and the lower\\\\nend to the CGU of Finland & Estonia. The higher end of the EBITA percentage range relates to the CGU of Hungary,\\\\nCzech Republic & Slovakia and the lower end to the CGU of Greece & Cyprus. The higher end of the pre-tax discount\\\\nrate range relates to the CGUs of Hungary, Czech Republic & Slovakia and Italy (discount rate in Italy reduced compare\\\\nto Q2 2020 mainly due to a significant drop in the government bonds yield and reduced volatility (beta) of the optical\\\\nretail industry returns compared to the market). The lower end relates to the CGUs of Switzerland, Norway, Finland &\\\\nEstonia and Denmark.\\\\n\\\\nThe remaining CGUs within the Other Europe segment have average revenue growth rates, EBITA percentages and pre-\\\\ntax discount rates around the midpoint of the respective ranges.\\\\n\\\\nAmericas & Asia segment\\\\n\\\\nIn 2020, the higher end of the average revenue growth rate range mainly relates to the CGU of Turkey and the lower\\\\nend relates to the CGU of Chile & Uruguay and Russia. The higher end of the average EBITA percentage range relates to\\\\nthe CGU of the Turkey and the lower end relates to the CGU of Colombia. The higher end of the pre-tax discount rate\\\\nrange related to the CGU of Turkey, while the lower end related to the CGU of United States. The remaining CGUs within\\\\nthe Americas & Asia segment have average revenue growth rates, EBITA percentages and pre-tax discount rates around\\\\nthe midpoint of the respective ranges.\\\\n\\\\nThe assumptions for CGU of United States used in impairment test in the second quarter 2020, were updated in the\\\\nannual impairment test to include a change in a business strategy in the US market to have more focus on the store-in-\\\\nstore concept in the Walgreens pharmacy chain.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cSensitivity\\\\n\\\\nIn 2020, for the recoverable amount under expected cash flow approach, the most sensitive assumptions relate to the\\\\nprobabilities  (‘weights’)  of  each  scenario  and  a  discount  rate  (2019:  revenue  growth,  profit  assumptions  and  the\\\\ndiscount rate). A reasonably possible change to key assumptions would not result in a material impairment of goodwill\\\\nwhere the value-in-use method is used (2019: no material impairment). Allocation of 100% probability to Scenario W\\\\nwould not result in a material impairment of goodwill, except for the CGU of the United Kingdom & Ireland, where there\\\\nis a nil headroom with allocation of approximately 80% probability to Scenario W and 20% to Scenario U.\\\\n\\\\nIn the fair value less costs of disposal method based on the sales multiple, the sales multiple and the adjusted average\\\\nsales used are the sensitive key assumptions. A 10% reduction of the sales multiple used in the Group impairment test\\\\nwould not result in an impairment (2019: no impairment).\\\\n\\\\n14.

The\\\\nmajority of the customer database impairment relates to the Tesco customer database.\\\\n\\\\nImpairment Test of Tesco customer database\\\\nThe customer database relating to Tesco stores acquired in 2017 in the UK is amortized over 14 years. It has a carrying\\\\namount  of  €23,700  at  the  end  of  reporting  period,  after  impairment  of  €20,548.  The  recoverable  amount  for  the\\\\nimpairment  test  purposes  was  determined  based  on  a  fair  value  less  costs  of  disposal  model  (level  3).  The  model\\\\nincludes  discounted  cash  inflows  based  on  future  revenue  from  customers  ‘acquired’  as  part  of  the  transfer  of  the\\\\nTesco Opticians database, together with the costs incurred in meeting that demand. The projections cover a twelve-year\\\\nperiod (remaining useful life of the customer database). Key assumptions used are as follows: (a) expected revenue\\\\ngrowth of 2%; (b) a churn rate; (c) post-tax discount rate of 5.7%.\\\\n\\\\nThe most sensitive key assumption in the impairment test of the Tesco customer database relates to revenue growth\\\\nrate. A reduction of the expected revenue growth to the level of 1%, with all other factors used in calculating the fair\\\\nvalue less costs of disposal remaining unchanged, would lead to an additional impairment of €4.0 million. In light of\\\\nthe significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economic outlook and business forecasts, the impact of Brexit\\\\nhas remained immaterially low.

Inventories\\\\n\\\\nAccounting Policy\\\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined by the weighted average cost\\\\nmethod. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of\\\\ncompletion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. A new assessment of the net realizable value is made\\\\nin each subsequent period. When the circumstances that previously caused inventories to be written down below cost\\\\nare no longer existing or when there is clear evidence of an increase in the net realizable value because of changed\\\\neconomic  circumstances,  the  amount  of  the  write-down  is  reversed.  Costs  of  inventories  include  gains/losses  on\\\\nqualifying cash flow hedges transferred from equity at the moment of initial recognition of inventories.\\\\n\\\\n150\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\nThe composition of the inventories is as follows:\\\\n\\\\nin thousands of EUR\\\\n\\\\nFinished goods\\\\n\\\\nProvision for obsolete inventory\\\\n\\\\n31 December 2020\\\\n\\\\n31 December 2019\\\\n\\\\n334,056\\\\n\\\\n- 23,651\\\\n\\\\n310,405\\\\n\\\\n378,482\\\\n\\\\n- 22,223\\\\n\\\\n356,259\\\\n\\\\nAn amount of €15,329 (2019: €15,881) has been recognized in the consolidated Income Statement relating to obsolete\\\\ninventories in ’Cost of sales and directly related costs’.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c16. Trade and Other Receivables\\\\n\\\\nAccounting Policy\\\\n\\\\nAt  initial  recognition,  financial  assets  are  classified  as  either  measured  at  amortized  cost,  fair  value  through  other\\\\ncomprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. The classification depends on the Group’s business model\\\\nfor  managing  the  asset  and  the  contractual  cash  flow  characteristics  of  the  asset.  The  Group  does  not  have  assets\\\\nmeasured at fair value through other comprehensive income.\\\\n\\\\nFinancial assets are initially recognized on the trade date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase the asset.\\\\nFinancial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have\\\\nbeen  transferred  and  the  Group  has  transferred  substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership.  Upon\\\\nderecognition any gain or loss are recognized in the consolidated Income Statement.\\\\n\\\\nFinancial assets at amortized cost\\\\n\\\\nFinancial assets at amortized cost are financial assets held within a business model aimed at holding the asset in order\\\\nto  collect  contractual  cash  flows.  Timing  of  these  cash  flows  is  determined  in  the  contract  and  comprise  solely\\\\npayments of principle and interest. Assets measured at amortized cost are initially recognized at fair value plus any\\\\ndirectly  attributable  transaction  costs.  For  trade  receivables,  the  transaction  price  is  deemed  to  be  equal  to  the  fair\\\\nvalue. Subsequently, these assets are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method less any allowance\\\\nfor expected credit losses.\\\\n\\\\nInterest income on assets is recognized in the consolidated Income Statement.\\\\n\\\\nImpairment of financial assets\\\\n\\\\nThe Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized\\\\ncost and at fair value through other comprehensive income. The resulting allowance is generally based on a 12-month\\\\nexpected credit loss. When credit risk on an asset increases significantly the calculation of the expected credit loss is\\\\nbased on the full lifetime of the financial asset.\\\\n\\\\nThe  Group  applies  judgement  in  its  assessments  of  credit  risk  and  expected  credit  losses  based  on  current  and\\\\nhistorical data as well as forward-looking estimates. Changes in the allowance are recorded in the consolidated Income\\\\nStatement with a reduction to the carrying value of financial assets measured at amortized cost, as an expected credit\\\\nloss provision.\\\\n\\\\nThe Group applies the full lifetime credit loss method to trade receivables that have a maturity of one year or less. The\\\\nGroup applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses for trade receivables (i.e. provision\\\\nmatrix).\\\\n\\\\nFor financial assets measured at amortized cost, the Group applies the general approach under IFRS 9. The resulting\\\\nallowance is generally based on a 12-month expected credit loss. When credit risk on an asset increases significantly\\\\nthe calculation of the expected credit loss is based on the full lifetime of the financial asset. The Group considers the\\\\nprobability of default upon initial recognition of the asset and whether there has been a significant increase in credit\\\\nrisk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. A significant increase in credit risk is presumed if a debtor\\\\nis past due in making a contractual payment for a period outside of normal business practices. A default on a financial\\\\nasset  occurs  when  the  counterparty  fails  to  make  contractual  payments  for  a  period  significantly  outside  of  normal\\\\nbusiness practices.\\\\n\\\\nWhen using the general approach, for financial assets measured at amortized cost other than trade receivables with a\\\\nlow risk of default and a strong capacity to meet contractual cash flows, a 12-month expected credit loss provision is\\\\nrecognized. For financial assets measured at amortized cost other than trade receivables with a significant increase in\\\\ncredit risk and debtors that have defaulted, the expected credit loss provision is recognized based on lifetime expected\\\\ncredit losses. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value\\\\nof estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.\\\\n\\\\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. This\\\\nis generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have any assets or other sources of income\\\\nthat could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the relevant amount.\\\\n\\\\n151\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cImpairment losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost are included in the selling and marketing costs in the\\\\nconsolidated Income Statement.

Derivatives are only\\\\nused for economic hedging purposes and not as speculative investments.\\\\n\\\\nDerivatives are initially recognized in the consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value on the date a derivative contract is\\\\nentered into (trade date) and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The fair value of financial instruments\\\\nthat are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is derived from valuations performed\\\\nby  financial  institutions  and  other  third  parties,  using  valuation  techniques  such  as  mathematical  models  (Black-\\\\nScholes). The Group uses its judgment to make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at\\\\neach reporting date.\\\\n\\\\nThe method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging\\\\ninstrument, and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.\\\\n\\\\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  derivatives  that  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting  are  recognized  immediately  in  the\\\\nconsolidated Income Statement as finance income and finance costs.\\\\n\\\\nThe full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of\\\\nthe hedged item is more than 12 months. It is classified as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of\\\\nthe hedged item is less than 12 months.\\\\n\\\\n161\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cHedge accounting\\\\n\\\\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as either:\\\\n\\\\n• hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges);\\\\n• hedges of the fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedges).\\\\n\\\\nThe Group assesses and documents, both at the inception of the transaction and on an ongoing basis through periodic\\\\nprospective effectiveness assessments, the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and\\\\nhedged  item  based  on  the  amount  and  timing  of  the  respective  cash  flows.  The  Group  also  documents  its  risk\\\\nmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.\\\\n\\\\nWhen  all  relevant  criteria  are  met,  hedge  accounting  is  applied  to  remove  the  accounting  mismatch  between  the\\\\nhedging instrument and the hedged item. This will effectively result in recognizing interest expense at a fixed interest\\\\nrate for the hedged floating rate loans and inventory at the fixed foreign currency rate for the hedged purchases.\\\\n\\\\nThe  Group  only  designates  the  spot  component  of  foreign  currency  forwards  in  hedge  relationships.  The  spot\\\\ncomponent  is  determined  with  reference  to  relevant  spot  market  exchange  rates.  The  differential  between  the\\\\ncontracted  forward  rate  and  the  spot  market  exchange  rate  is  defined  as  the  forward  points.  The  changes  in  the\\\\nforward element of the foreign currency forwards are recognized in the consolidated Income Statement.\\\\n\\\\n162\\\\n\\\\nCash flow hedge\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\nOn  the  date  a  derivative  contract  is  entered  into,  the  Group  designates  interest  rate  swaps  and  foreign  currency\\\\nforwards  (hedge  instruments)  as  a  hedge  of  the  exposure  to  the  fluctuations  in  the  variable  interest  rates  on\\\\nborrowings and foreign currency exchange rates on future transactions, respectively (hedged items).\\\\n\\\\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is\\\\nrecognized  in  the  consolidated  Other  Comprehensive  Income.  The  gain  or  loss  relating  to  the  ineffective  portion  is\\\\nrecognized  immediately  in  the  consolidated  Income  Statement.  Amounts  accumulated  in  the  consolidated  Other\\\\nComprehensive Income are recycled in the consolidated Income Statement in the periods when the underlying hedged\\\\nitem affects profit or loss.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, when the projected transaction that is hedged, results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example\\\\ninventory), the gains and losses previously deferred in the consolidated Other Comprehensive Income are transferred\\\\nfrom equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset as a basis adjustment.\\\\n\\\\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any\\\\ncumulative gain or loss existing in the consolidated Other Comprehensive Income at that time remains in equity and is\\\\nrecognized when the projected transaction is ultimately recognized in the consolidated Income Statement or for a non-\\\\nfinancial asset, within the cost of the asset. When a projected transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative\\\\ngain  or  loss  that  was  reported  in  the  consolidated  Other  Comprehensive  Income  is  immediately  transferred  to  the\\\\nconsolidated Income Statement in finance costs or finance income.\\\\n\\\\nFair value hedge\\\\n\\\\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  derivatives  that  are  designated  and  qualify  as  fair  value  hedges  are  recorded  in  the\\\\nconsolidated Income Statement as finance costs or finance income, together with any changes in the fair value of the\\\\nhedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cThe fair value of the derivatives is as follows:\\\\n\\\\nin thousands of EUR\\\\n\\\\n31 December 2020\\\\n\\\\n31 December 2019\\\\n\\\\nAssets\\\\n\\\\nLiabilities\\\\n\\\\nAssets\\\\n\\\\nLiabilities\\\\n\\\\nNon-current\\\\n\\\\nInterest rate derivatives – cash flow hedges\\\\n\\\\nCurrent\\\\n\\\\nInterest rate derivatives – cash flow hedges\\\\n\\\\nCurrency derivatives – cash flow hedges\\\\n\\\\nTotal derivatives\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n728\\\\n\\\\n728\\\\n\\\\n728\\\\n\\\\n8,174\\\\n\\\\n8,174\\\\n\\\\n3,142\\\\n\\\\n7,246\\\\n\\\\n10,388\\\\n\\\\n18,562\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n1,581\\\\n\\\\n1,581\\\\n\\\\n1,581\\\\n\\\\n7,935\\\\n\\\\n7,935\\\\n\\\\n3,303\\\\n\\\\n2,803\\\\n\\\\n6,106\\\\n\\\\n14,041\\\\n\\\\nThe  Group’s  risk  management  strategy  has  not  changed  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.

The accounting treatment depends on the conclusion\\\\non  the  probability  of  the  forecasted  transactions  occurring.  Based  on  the  analysis,  all  the  effectiveness  criteria\\\\ncontinued  to  be  met  and  thus,  GrandVision  continued  to  apply  Hedge  Accounting  for  all  the  currency  derivatives\\\\nthroughout the year.\\\\n\\\\nIn  both  2020  and  2019,  the  derivatives  met  the  requirements  for  hedge  accounting  in  full.

The Group\\\\\\'s policy is to maintain a minimum of 60% of its net debt on a forward looking 12\\\\nmonths basis, related to interest rate risk at fixed rate, using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. The Group also uses\\\\n0% floors to hedge its exposure to negative interest rates.\\\\n\\\\nThe Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item\\\\nbased on the interest rate, reset dates, payment dates, maturities and notional amount. As the Group only hedges 60%\\\\nof  the  cash  flows  related  to  interest  rate  risk,  the  hedged  items  are  therefore  identified  as  a  proportion  of  the\\\\noutstanding borrowings up to the notional amount of the swaps.\\\\n\\\\nThe nominal amount of the bank borrowings (see note 22) hedged by interest rate derivatives amounts to €425 million\\\\n(2019: €475 million) which includes €325 million (2019: €375 million) of 0% floors to hedge the impact of negative\\\\ninterest rates.\\\\n\\\\nThe effects of the interest rate swaps on the Group’s consolidated Balance Sheet and consolidated Income Statement\\\\nare as follows:\\\\n\\\\n163\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\nin thousands of EUR\\\\n\\\\nCarrying amount (liabilities)\\\\n\\\\nNotional amount\\\\n\\\\nMaturity Date\\\\n\\\\nHedge ratio\\\\n\\\\nChange in fair value of outstanding hedging instruments since 1 January\\\\n\\\\nChange in value of hedged item used to determine hedge effectiveness\\\\n\\\\nWeighted average hedged rate for the year\\\\n\\\\n31 December 2020\\\\n\\\\n31 December 2019\\\\n\\\\n- 11,316\\\\n\\\\n425,000\\\\n\\\\n- 11,238\\\\n\\\\n475,000\\\\n\\\\nMarch 2021 - December 2026\\\\n\\\\nSeptember 2020-December 2026\\\\n\\\\n1:1\\\\n\\\\n- 79\\\\n\\\\n79\\\\n\\\\n0.60%\\\\n\\\\n1:1\\\\n\\\\n- 5,805\\\\n\\\\n5,805\\\\n\\\\n0.59%\\\\n\\\\nCurrency derivatives\\\\nThe Group has transactional cash flows relating to future commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities\\\\ndenominated  in  multiple  currencies  which  are  exposed  to  the  volatility  of  these  currencies  against  the  euro.

The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold\\\\nsufficient  assets  to  pay  all  employees  the  benefits  relating  to  employee  service  in  the  current  and  prior  periods.  A\\\\ndefined  benefit  plan  is  a  post-employment  benefit  plan  that  is  not  a  defined  contribution  plan.  Typically,  defined\\\\nbenefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on\\\\none or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.\\\\n\\\\nThe liability in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit of obligations at the\\\\nbalance sheet date minus the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for actuarial gains/losses and past\\\\nservice costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit\\\\ncredit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by the estimated future cash outflows\\\\nusing the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will\\\\nbe paid and which have terms of maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation. Remeasurement\\\\nof gains and losses related to both defined benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets arising from experience\\\\nadjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in equity in Other Comprehensive Income in the\\\\nperiod in which they arise. Past service costs are recognized immediately in the consolidated Income Statement.\\\\n\\\\nIn  a  number  of  countries,  the  Group  runs  defined  contribution  plans,  including  a  multi-employer  plan  in  the\\\\nNetherlands.  The  contributions  are  recognized  as  employee  benefit  expense  when  they  are  due.  The  Group  has  no\\\\nfurther payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.\\\\n\\\\nOther post-employment obligations\\\\n\\\\nSome entities within the Group provide post-employment healthcare benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to these\\\\nbenefits  is  conditional  on  the  employee  remaining  in  service  up  to  retirement  age  and  includes  the  estimation  that\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c(former)  employees  will  make  use  of  this  arrangement.  The  expected  costs  of  these  benefits  are  accrued  over  the\\\\nperiod of employment using the same accounting methodology as the defined benefit pension plans.\\\\n\\\\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Judgments\\\\nThe present value of the defined benefit pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on\\\\nan  actuarial  basis  using  a  number  of  assumptions.  The  assumptions  used  in  determining  the  net  cost  (income)  for\\\\npensions are most sensitive for the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of\\\\ndefined benefit pension obligations.\\\\n\\\\nThe Group determines the appropriate discount rate at year-end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be\\\\nused to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the defined\\\\nbenefit  pension  obligations.  In  determining  the  appropriate  discount  rate,  the  Group  considers  the  interest  rates  of\\\\nhigh-quality corporate bonds with a duration and currency consistent with the term and currency of the related defined\\\\nbenefit pension obligation.\\\\n\\\\nThe amounts recognized in the consolidated Balance Sheet are determined as follows:\\\\n\\\\nin thousands of EUR\\\\n\\\\nPresent value of benefit obligation\\\\n\\\\nFair value of plan assets\\\\n\\\\nNet position\\\\n\\\\nPresent value of unfunded obligation\\\\n\\\\nProvision in the Balance Sheet\\\\n\\\\n31 December 2020\\\\n\\\\n31 December 2019\\\\n\\\\n145,616\\\\n\\\\n- 82,582\\\\n\\\\n63,034\\\\n\\\\n87,443\\\\n\\\\n150,477\\\\n\\\\n134,165\\\\n\\\\n- 79,531\\\\n\\\\n54,634\\\\n\\\\n81,478\\\\n\\\\n136,112\\\\n\\\\nThe most recent actuarial valuations were performed in December 2020.\\\\n\\\\nThe defined benefit obligation of the unfunded plans mainly relates to:\\\\n\\\\n• A pension arrangement, in addition to the state pension provided in Germany, for employees already employed with\\\\nApollo prior to 1994 (2020: €62.9 million; 2019: €60.5 million). Every service year of the employees in the plan adds\\\\nan amount of 1% of their pensionable salaries to the plan. This occurs for a maximum of 25 years and is maximized\\\\nin terms of pay-out.\\\\n\\\\n• The Italian Trattamento di Fine Rapporto program (2020: €4.1 million; 2019: €4.3 million) for service years until\\\\n2012. For service years since 2013 the Trattamento di Fine Rapporto is paid to a pension fund or a state agency as a\\\\ndefined contribution.\\\\n\\\\n• An  end-of-employment  plan  for  French  employees  (2020:  €18.3  million;  2019:  €16.4  million).  This  is  based  on\\\\n\\\\nservice years and calculated according to the estimated remuneration in the last year of employment.\\\\n\\\\nThese plans are unfunded and thus both the pay-out and the actuarial risks are the responsibility of the Group.\\\\n\\\\nThe net defined benefit obligation of the funded plans mainly relates to the Swiss pension plan of €57.7 million (2019:\\\\n€48.8 million). The assets of the plan at 31 December 2020 are €79.8 million (2019: €76.4 million) and the obligations\\\\nof the plan at 31 December 2020 are €137.5 million (2019: €125.2 million). The pension arrangements (occupational\\\\npension  plans)  of  Swiss  activities  are  funded  plans,  providing  benefits  upon  retirement,  death,  disability  and\\\\ntermination. Those arrangements are the base of the second pillar of the Swiss social security system. Both employer\\\\nand  employees  pay  contributions  to  the  pension  plan.

Share-based Payment Plans\\\\n\\\\nAccounting Policy\\\\nCertain members of senior management participate in share-based payment plans. The Group operates the following\\\\ntypes of share-based payment plans.\\\\n\\\\nEquity plan\\\\n\\\\nThe equity plan provides for the purchase of shares in the Company by eligible participants and is subject to a vesting\\\\nterm and holding conditions. Vesting of awards made under the equity plan is subject to a service condition that can\\\\nvary  between  3-5  years  following  the  date  of  grant.  The  plan  has  been  classified  as  an  equity-settled  share-based\\\\npayment arrangement.\\\\n\\\\nThe equity plans are no longer granted since the listing of the Company’s shares.

These option awards are in the form of cash-settled share appreciation rights, meaning that at exercise the\\\\nparticipant receives cash which is in total equal in value to the total value of the exercised options.\\\\n\\\\nFor cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the fair value of the liability for the awards made is measured at\\\\neach reporting date and at the settlement date. The fair value is recognized over the vesting period. The amount of\\\\nexpense recognized takes into account the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to\\\\nvest under the service and performance conditions underlying each share and option award granted.\\\\n\\\\nLong-term incentive plan (LTIP) – equity settled\\\\n\\\\nLTIP  awards  can  consist  of  shares  and/or  options,  which  contain  a  service  condition  of  3-5  years  and  can  contain\\\\nadditional performance conditions based on the results of certain predetermined Group related financial performance\\\\ntargets, which are treated as non-market vesting conditions. The option awards have a maximum term of 5 years.\\\\n\\\\nThe long-term incentive plan (LTIP) represents conditional share and option awards. Option awards are in the form of\\\\nequity-settled  share  appreciation  rights,  meaning  that  at  exercise  the  participant  receives  shares  which  are  in  total\\\\nequal in value to the total value of the exercised options.\\\\n\\\\nThe fair value at grant date of equity-settled share-based payment transactions is expensed over the vesting period\\\\nwith  a  corresponding  increase  in  equity,  taking  into  account  the  best  available  estimate  of  the  number  of  shares\\\\nexpected to vest under the service and performance conditions.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cThe table below shows the total expense of the share-based payment plans as well as the movements in liability and\\\\nequity.\\\\n\\\\nin thousands of EUR\\\\n\\\\nLong-term incentive plan\\\\n\\\\nEquity plan\\\\n\\\\nAt 1 January 2019\\\\n\\\\nCharges to Income Statement\\\\n\\\\nSettlements/ Vesting\\\\n\\\\nExchange differences\\\\n\\\\nAt 31 December 2019\\\\n\\\\nAt 1 January 2020\\\\n\\\\nCharges to Income Statement\\\\n\\\\nSettlements/ Vesting\\\\n\\\\nExchange differences\\\\n\\\\nAt 31 December 2020\\\\n\\\\nLiability\\\\n\\\\n786\\\\n\\\\n- 609\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n17\\\\n\\\\n194\\\\n\\\\n194\\\\n\\\\n- 191\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n- 3\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\nEquity\\\\n\\\\n5,536\\\\n\\\\n5,636\\\\n\\\\n- 2,913\\\\n\\\\n- 10\\\\n\\\\n8,249\\\\n\\\\n8,249\\\\n\\\\n5,868\\\\n\\\\n- 3,574\\\\n\\\\n- 4\\\\n\\\\n10,539\\\\n\\\\nEquity\\\\n\\\\n2,529\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n- 2,529\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\nn.a\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\nn.a\\\\n\\\\nThe number of participants of the share-based payment plans per year-end 2020 is 175 (2019: 160).\\\\n\\\\nThe table shows the valuation method of the Group\\\\\\'s share-based payment plans:\\\\n\\\\nClassification\\\\n\\\\nShare awards\\\\n\\\\nOption awards\\\\n\\\\nCash-settled\\\\n\\\\nShare price at 31 December Black-Scholes-Merton option model\\\\n\\\\nEquity plan\\\\n\\\\nn/a\\\\n\\\\nEquity-settled\\\\n\\\\nShare price at grant date\\\\n\\\\nShare price at grant date\\\\n\\\\nBlack-Scholes-Merton option model\\\\n\\\\nEquity plan\\\\n\\\\nDuring 2019 the full balance of equity plan of employees was settled.\\\\n\\\\nAt 1 January 2019\\\\n\\\\nSettled\\\\n\\\\nAt 31 December 2019\\\\n\\\\nLong-term incentive plan (LTIP)\\\\n\\\\nEmployees\\\\n\\\\n145,410\\\\n\\\\n- 145,410\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\nThe plan includes a clause governing the consequences of a change of control event: If a fundamental change takes\\\\nplace in the management and structure of GrandVision, due to a merger, acquisition, sale or similar transaction, the\\\\nawards  shall  vest  on  a  pro  rata  basis  for  the  period  from  the  commencement  of  the  LTIP  until  the  date  that  the\\\\ntransaction is completed definitely.

Provisions and Contingent Liabilities\\\\n\\\\nAccounting Policy\\\\nProvisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is\\\\nprobable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount\\\\ncan be made. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the\\\\nobligation  using  a  pre-tax  rate  that  reflects  current  market  assessments  of  the  time  value  of  money  and  the  risks\\\\nspecific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as interest expense.\\\\n\\\\nProvisions are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to postpone settlement for, or\\\\nthe provision is due to be settled at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.\\\\n\\\\nLegal and regulatory provisions\\\\n\\\\nLegal and regulatory provisions are recognized for possible claims mainly related to governmental institutions.\\\\n\\\\nWarranty provisions\\\\n\\\\nProvisions for rectifying and replacement defects are classified as warranty provisions. The provision is based on past\\\\nexperience  and  future  expectations  of  warranty  claims.  Warranty  costs  are  recognized  in  the  consolidated  Income\\\\nStatement under cost of sales and directly related costs.\\\\n\\\\nEmployee-related provisions\\\\n\\\\nEmployee-related provisions are mainly related to jubilee, termination benefits and retention bonuses. Jubilee benefits\\\\nare paid to employees upon completion of a certain number of years of service. Termination benefits are payable when\\\\nemployment  is  terminated  by  the  Group  before  the  normal  retirement  date,  or  whenever  an  employee  accepts\\\\nvoluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.\\\\n\\\\nOther provisions\\\\n\\\\nOther provisions are mainly related to restructuring provisions.\\\\n\\\\nRestructuring provisions comprise costs related to returning a store or office to its original state.\\\\n\\\\nBank borrowings to franchisees of the Group are often secured by a guarantee given by the Group to the landlord. The\\\\nguarantees  given  are  secured  by  the  activities,  store  rental  contracts,  the  inventories  and  store  furniture  of  the\\\\nfranchisees.  When  a  cash  outflow  is  likely,  a  provision  is  recognized,  being  the  present  value  of  the  expected  cash\\\\noutflow. If a cash outflow is not likely, the guarantee is included in the contingent liabilities.\\\\n\\\\nContingent liabilities\\\\n\\\\nContingent liabilities are possible or present obligations of sufficient uncertainty that it does not qualify for recognition\\\\nas  a  provision,  unless  it  is  assumed  in  a  business  combination.

The main estimates relate to the probability (\\\\\\'more likely than not\\\\\\') of the outflow of resources. If the outflow\\\\nof  resources  is  \\\\\\'more  likely  than  not\\\\\\'  a  best  estimate  of  the  outflow  is  recognized.  Otherwise,  it  is  disclosed  as  a\\\\ncontingency.\\\\n\\\\nIf a provision is recognized, it is measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the\\\\nobligation  using  a  pre-tax  rate  that  reflects  current  market  assessments  of  the  time  value  of  money  and  the  risks\\\\nspecific to the obligation. The expected expenditures are uncertain future cash flows for which management uses its\\\\nknowledge, experience and judgment to determine if a corresponding provision should be recognized.\\\\n\\\\nMovements in provisions are as follows:\\\\n\\\\nin thousands of EUR\\\\n\\\\nAt 1 January 2019\\\\n\\\\nMovements in 2019\\\\n\\\\nAddition to provision\\\\n\\\\nReversal of provision\\\\n\\\\nUtilized during the year\\\\n\\\\nExchange differences\\\\n\\\\nAt 31 December 2019\\\\n\\\\nNon-current\\\\n\\\\nCurrent\\\\n\\\\nAt 31 December 2019\\\\n\\\\nAt 1 January 2020\\\\n\\\\nMovements in 2020\\\\n\\\\nAddition to provision\\\\n\\\\nReversal of provision\\\\n\\\\nUtilized during the year\\\\n\\\\nExchange differences\\\\n\\\\nAt 31 December 2020\\\\n\\\\nNon-current\\\\n\\\\nCurrent\\\\n\\\\nAt 31 December 2020\\\\n\\\\nLegal and\\\\nregulatory\\\\n\\\\nWarranty\\\\n\\\\nEmployee-\\\\nrelated\\\\n\\\\nShare based\\\\npayments\\\\n\\\\n18,514\\\\n\\\\n3,727\\\\n\\\\n8,932\\\\n\\\\n786\\\\n\\\\n2,142\\\\n\\\\n- 490\\\\n\\\\n- 375\\\\n\\\\n- 135\\\\n\\\\n19,656\\\\n\\\\n11,257\\\\n\\\\n8,399\\\\n\\\\n19,656\\\\n\\\\n3,140\\\\n\\\\n- 162\\\\n\\\\n- 2,630\\\\n\\\\n8\\\\n\\\\n4,083\\\\n\\\\n355\\\\n\\\\n3,728\\\\n\\\\n4,083\\\\n\\\\n8,715\\\\n\\\\n- 1,241\\\\n\\\\n- 2,180\\\\n\\\\n- 163\\\\n\\\\n14,063\\\\n\\\\n5,974\\\\n\\\\n8,089\\\\n\\\\n14,063\\\\n\\\\n19,656\\\\n\\\\n4,083\\\\n\\\\n14,063\\\\n\\\\n2,970\\\\n\\\\n- 145\\\\n\\\\n- 135\\\\n\\\\n- 436\\\\n\\\\n21,910\\\\n\\\\n12,619\\\\n\\\\n9,291\\\\n\\\\n21,910\\\\n\\\\n2,824\\\\n\\\\n- 77\\\\n\\\\n- 3,052\\\\n\\\\n- 8\\\\n\\\\n3,770\\\\n\\\\n340\\\\n\\\\n3,430\\\\n\\\\n3,770\\\\n\\\\n14,759\\\\n\\\\n- 1,565\\\\n\\\\n- 3,515\\\\n\\\\n- 92\\\\n\\\\n23,650\\\\n\\\\n8,891\\\\n\\\\n14,759\\\\n\\\\n23,650\\\\n\\\\n149\\\\n\\\\n- 758\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n17\\\\n\\\\n194\\\\n\\\\n194\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n194\\\\n\\\\n194\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n- 194\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\nOther\\\\n\\\\n1,710\\\\n\\\\n3,555\\\\n\\\\n- 379\\\\n\\\\n- 655\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\n4,231\\\\n\\\\n413\\\\n\\\\n3,818\\\\n\\\\n4,231\\\\n\\\\nTotal\\\\n\\\\n33,669\\\\n\\\\n17,701\\\\n\\\\n- 3,030\\\\n\\\\n- 5,840\\\\n\\\\n- 273\\\\n\\\\n42,227\\\\n\\\\n18,193\\\\n\\\\n24,034\\\\n\\\\n42,227\\\\n\\\\n4,231\\\\n\\\\n42,227\\\\n\\\\n1,684\\\\n\\\\n- 95\\\\n\\\\n- 3,405\\\\n\\\\n- 295\\\\n\\\\n2,120\\\\n\\\\n809\\\\n\\\\n1,311\\\\n\\\\n2,120\\\\n\\\\n22,237\\\\n\\\\n- 2,076\\\\n\\\\n- 10,107\\\\n\\\\n- 831\\\\n\\\\n51,450\\\\n\\\\n22,659\\\\n\\\\n28,791\\\\n\\\\n51,450\\\\n\\\\n173\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nC\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\nS\\\\nO\\\\nL\\\\nI\\\\nD\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nD\\\\nF\\\\nI\\\\nN\\\\nA\\\\nN\\\\nC\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nA\\\\nL\\\\nS\\\\nT\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nE\\\\nM\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nT\\\\nS\\\\n\\\\nLegal and regulatory\\\\nLegal and regulatory provision mainly relates to the investigation initiated by a dawn raid undertaken by the French\\\\nCompetition Authority (Autorite de la Concurrence or ADLC) of the GrandVision France offices on June 24, 2009. Solaris\\\\nwas not part of the dawn raid. The ADLC also raided suppliers (e.g. Luxottica, Safilo) and other distributors (e.g. Afflelou,\\\\nCentrale  des  Opticiens,  Alliance  Optique,  Optic  2000,  Krys).  The  ADLC  was  looking  for  information  on  resale  price\\\\nmaintenance. In Sept/Oct 2011 a number of GrandVision employees were heard and some documents were provided\\\\nto  the  ADLC.  After  a  long  silence,  we  received  a  questionnaire  from  the  ADLC  in  this  matter  on  May  9,  2014  and\\\\nprovided our answers on September 29, 2014, in accordance with the deadline imposed by the ADLC. On May 27, 2015\\\\nwe were formally served with a Notice of Objections from the ADLC, formally accusing us, and all other defendants, of\\\\nresale price maintenance in France during 2004-2009. The Notice of Objections is a confidential document and does\\\\nnot contain a fine. We submitted an initial response to this Notice of Objections on July 27, 2015 with the assistance of\\\\nLinklaters France. On July 22, 2016 we received the official Rapport, which is the next procedural step, from the ADLC.\\\\nThe Rapport did not contain any surprises and confirmed our assumptions with respect to the calculation of the fine.\\\\nWe submitted our official response to this Rapport on October 26, 2016. An Audience (confidential hearing) was held\\\\nby the ADLC on December 15, 2016 allowing the defendants to defend their legal position. On February 24, 2017, the\\\\nCollege of the ADLC sent the matter back to the case handlers. After a long period of inaction, on April 19, 2019 an\\\\nadditional Notice of Objections was received by a number of defendants, not including GrandVision. Another Audience\\\\nwas held before the ADLC on January 13, 2021. The ADLC has not yet reached a decision following this Audience.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cSecondly,  the  provision  relates  mainly  to  the  Group\\\\\\'s  ongoing  tax  risk  management  process  in  which  it  determines\\\\npotential  fiscal  claims  on  VAT  and  other  taxes  in  various  countries.  The  additions  in  2019  mainly  relate  to  VAT  and\\\\nother tax risks in Germany and Austria.\\\\n\\\\nEmployee-related\\\\nThe additions in 2020 and 2019 relate mainly to jubilee benefits to employees upon completion of a certain number of\\\\nyears of service, employee expenses related to the announced acquisition of GrandVision shares by EssilorLuxottica\\\\nand severance costs of certain employees as a part of restructuring activities.\\\\n\\\\nOther\\\\nIn 2020, provision related to restructuring of activities in China, recognized in 2019, was utilized.\\\\n\\\\nSummary of Group\\\\\\'s contingent liabilities\\\\n\\\\nAs a multinational company being present in many jurisdictions the Group is involved in a number of tax proceedings.\\\\nOne  of  such  proceedings  is  that  in  November  2015  the  Group  received  a  report  from  the  German  tax  authorities\\\\nfollowing their tax audit covering Apollo-Optik in the years 2008-2012. This report included findings and viewpoints of\\\\nthe tax authorities on German VAT aspects. The Group is contesting the viewpoints of the German tax authorities on\\\\nthe  tax  position  and  will  defend  its  position  vigorously,  if  needed  in  court.  As  the  Group  is  sufficiently  confident  to\\\\nsustain its position on this matter, no provision has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. If the\\\\nGroup  is  unsuccessful  in  resolving  this  matter,  the  exposure,  including  the  period  after  2012,  is  €34.5  million.  The\\\\nmatter remains pending while formalities have not been further processed by authorities during 2020.\\\\n\\\\n27. Trade and Other Payables\\\\n\\\\nAccounting Policy\\\\nTrade  payables  are  obligations  to  pay  for  goods  or  services  that  have  been  acquired  from  suppliers  in  the  ordinary\\\\ncourse of business.

(‘the Company’), Haarlemmermeer. The financial statements include the Consolidated Financial Statements of GrandVision N.V. and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’) and the Parent Company Financial Statements.The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise:• the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2020;• the following statements for 2020: the Consolidated Income Statement and the Consolidated Statement of Compre-hensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and Consolidated Cash Flow Statement; and• the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, comprising the significant accounting policies and other explan-atory information.The Parent Company Financial Statements comprise:• the Balance Sheet (Before Appropriation of Result) as at 31 December 2020;• the Income Statement for the year then ended; and• the Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements, comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information.The financial reporting framework applied in the preparation of the financial statements is EU-IFRS and the relevant provisions of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the Consolidated Financial Statements and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the Parent Company Financial Statements. The basis for our opinionWe conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. We have further described our responsibilities under those standards in the section ‘Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ of our report.To: the General Meeting and the Supervisory Board of GrandVision N.V. \\\\n\\\\x0cWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.IndependenceWe are independent of GrandVision N.V. in accordance with the European Union Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the ‘Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties’ (Wta, Audit firms super-vision act), the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten’ (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the ‘Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants’ (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). Our audit approachOverview and contextGrandVision N.V. is a global (optical) retail company. The Group is comprised of several components and therefore we considered our group audit scope and approach as set out in the section ‘The scope of our group audit’. We paid specific attention to the areas of focus driven by the operations of the Group, as set out below.COVID-19 characterised the 2020 financial year; this relates to both the financial statements and the audit thereof. In section 2.2 of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements the Company reflected on the impact of COVID-19 on the operations. As part of designing our audit, we considered the impact of COVID-19 as follows: • in the determination of materiality as described in the section ‘Materiality’;• in the determination of certain focus areas for the audit (both at group and the component team level) including but not limited to the valuation of assets, accounting for government grants and deferred tax accounting;• the adherence to internal control activities considering working remotely.The majority of the audits for the Group and components is carried out remotely. This means that in the execution of our group audit, no physical visits have been performed to the components. Instead we conducted all the meetings and performed our file reviews virtually. We have been able to physically perform the inventory count procedures. Despite that, meetings with local management and component teams were held virtually instead of physically. This has proven to be an effective and efficient approach. Through the combination of our procedures, the impact of COVID-19 did not lead to any omission in the execution of the audit. We assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where the Man-agement Board made important judgements, for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain, including the impact of COVID-19.In section 2.8 of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements the Company describes the areas of judgement in applying accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty. Given the significant estimation uncertainty, the impact of COVID-19 and the related higher inherent risks of material misstatement in the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, we considered this matter as key audit matter as set out in the section ‘Key audit matter’ of this report. Last year, we considered the recognition of a right of use asset and a lease liability as part of first-year adoption of the lease standard (IFRS 16) as a key audit matter. As this was completed in 2019, we no longer consider this to be a key audit matter. In addition, no (significant) acquisitions were completed in 2020 neither were there any significant accounting matters with respect to (uncertain) tax positions. As such, also both of these items were not considered as key audit matters for 2020.Another area of focus, that was not considered a key audit matter, was the risk of fraud in revenue recognition. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the management board that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.We ensured that the audit teams at both group and component level included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of a global (optical) retail company. We therefore included specialists in the areas of IT, corporate income taxes and accounting as well as valuations and actuarial experts in our team.\\\\x0cMaterialityThe scope of our audit is influenced by the application of materiality, which is further explained in the section ‘Our re-sponsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’.Based on our professional judgement we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative con-siderations, helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and to evaluate the effect of identified misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole and on our opinion.Overall group materiality€14.1 million (2019: €17.2 million).Basis for determining materialityWe used our professional judgement to determine overall materiality. As a basis for our judgement we used 5% of a three years average of profit before tax, adjusted for impairment losses.Rationale for benchmark appliedWe used profit before tax as the primary benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, based on our analysis of the common information needs of users of the financial statements. On this basis, we believe that profit before tax is an important metric for the financial performance of the Group. Historically, we used profit before tax, adjust-ed for impairment losses, as our basis for determining materiality.In 2020, the results of GrandVision are significantly impacted by COVID-19. Accordingly, 2020 results are not con-sidered to be a fair representation of the general business performance of GrandVision. We evaluated alternative benchmarks for the determination of the materiality such as EBITDA and revenue, which would have led to a higher overall materiality, which we consider to be less in accordance with the stakeholders needs. As such, we applied an average profit before tax for a period of three years (2018-2020), adjusted for impairment losses, as the benchmark to determine materiality for 2020. Component materialityTo each component in our audit scope, we, based on our judgement, allocated materiality that is less than our over-all group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between €0.5 and €8.0 million. We also took misstatements and/or possible misstatements into account that, in our judgement, are material for qual-itative reasons.We agreed with the supervisory board that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above €250,000 (2019: €250,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qual-itative reasons.Materiality• Overall materiality: €14.1 million.Audit scope• We conducted audit work at 26 components in 34 countries.• As a result of COVID-19, no physical site visits were conducted by the group audit team. We fulfilled our oversight obligations through (amongst others) virtual site visits to 9 components: Apollo (Germany), Vision Express (the United Kingdom), GrandVision Benelux (the Nether-lands), GrandVision France, GrandVision Italy, MasVision (Spain), Opticas GrandVision Chile, For Eyes (United States) and GrandVision Mexico.• Audit coverage: 100% of consolidated revenue, 100% of consolidated total assets and 100% of consolidated profit before tax.Key audit matters• Assessment of valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets The outline of our audit approach was as follows:\\\\x0cThe scope of our group auditGrandVision N.V. is the parent company of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of GrandVision N.V.We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we, in aggregate, provide sufficient coverage of the Consolidated Fi-nancial Statements for us to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the management structure of the Group, the nature of operations of its components, the accounting processes and controls, and the markets in which the components of the Group operate. In establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work required to be performed at component level by the group engagement team and by each component auditor.The group audit primarily focussed on the four significant components: Apollo (Germany), Vision Express (the United Kingdom), GrandVision Benelux (the Netherlands) and GrandVision France. These four components were subject to audits of their complete financial information, as these components are individually financially significant to the Group. Addi-tionally, and as agreed with the Management Board and Supervisory Board, 22 components were selected for audits of complete financial information to achieve appropriate coverage on the Consolidated Financial Statements.In total, in performing these procedures, we achieved the following coverage on the financial line items:Revenue100%Total assets100%Profit before tax100%For all Dutch holding entities, as included in note 32 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the group engagement team performed the audit work. For all other locations that are in scope of the group audit, we used component auditors who are familiar with the local laws and regulations to perform the audit work. Where component auditors performed the work, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their audit work to be able to conclude whether we had obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.We issued audit instructions to the component audit teams in our audit scope. These instructions included amongst others our risk analysis, materiality and scope of the work. We explained to the component audit teams the structure of the Group, the main developments that are relevant for the component auditors, the risks identified, the materiality levels to be applied and our global audit approach. We had individual calls with each of the in-scope component audit teams during the year and upon conclusion of their work. The group engagement team attended the virtual meetings of the component teams with local and group management in which the outcome of the component audit was discussed. During these meetings, we discussed the significant accounting and audit issues identified by the component auditors, their reports, the findings of their procedures and other matters, which could be of relevance for the Consolidated Finan-cial Statements. The group engagement leader or senior members of the group engagement team reviewed all reports regarding the audit approach and findings of the component auditors.The group engagement team held virtual site visits with the component teams and local management of Apollo (Ger-many), Vision Express (the United Kingdom), GrandVision Benelux (the Netherlands) and GrandVision France, together referred to as segment ‘G4’, given the relative size of the locations. For each of these locations, we reviewed the selected working papers of the component auditors. In addition, on a rotational basis, the group engagement team virtually visited local management and component auditors of other components. In 2020, the components virtually visited were Grand-Vision Italy, MasVision (Spain), Opticas GrandVision Chile, For Eyes (United States) and GrandVision Mexico.The group engagement team performed the audit work on the group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a number of complex items at the Company’s head office. These include the goodwill impairment test, accounting for the long term incentive plan, the testing of certain central IT systems, the tax position and the discount rates with respect to IFRS 16. By performing the procedures above at components, combined with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence on the Group’s financial information, as a whole, to provide a basis for our opinion on the financial statements.\\\\x0cKey audit matterOur audit work and observationsAssessment of valuation of goodwill and other intangible assetsRefer to notes 2.8, 13 and 14 of the financial statements for the manage-ment board’s accounting policies and underlying assumptionsThe goodwill on the balance sheet of GrandVision N.V. amounts to €1,061 million as at 31 December 2020. Of this, €495 million relates to the countries in ‘the G4’ segment, €517 million to ‘Other Europe’ and €49 million to ‘Americas and Asia’. Next to that, the other intangible assets on the balance sheet of GrandVision amount to €350 million as at 31 December 2020.The measurement of the recoverable amount of groups of CGUs in this segment is based on the highest of the value in use (VIU) or the fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCOD). Each of those groups of CGUs rep-resents the Group’s investment in a country or group of countries. This is the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored for management purposes.The key assumptions in the discounted cash flow are the assumed growth rates, the margin improvements and the discount rates. Moreover, the scenario analysis made by management, reflecting the uncertainties of recoverability after COVID-19 is an important sensitive assumption as well. The discounted cash flow is highly dependent on the future achievability of the assumed growth rates and margin improvements. For some CGUs the FVLCOD is based on the sales multiple for which the key assumption is the sales multiple. In 2020, an impairment of €73.1 million on goodwill was recognised, of which the majority related to the CGU United States which is part of the segment ‘Americas & Asia’ and to the CGU Italy which is part of the seg-ment ‘Other Europe’. Furthermore, an impairment on the intangible asset relating to the Tesco customer database of €20.5 million was recognised (part of the segment ‘G4’).Given the high level of management judgement regarding the aforemen-tioned assumptions in the impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets, we considered this area to be important for our audit. We evaluated the Management Board’s policies and procedures to determine future cash flow forecasts under respective scenarios and considering the impact of COVID-19, the process by which they were drawn up and we also assessed design effectiveness of controls over the impairment process.Following certain triggering events identified as of June 2020, an impair-ment test was performed on seven CGUs. We mainly focussed on ‘United Kingdom & Ireland’ within the segment ‘G4’, ‘United States’ within the segment ‘Americas & Asia’ and ‘Italy’ within the segment ‘Other Europe’.  For these entities the management board prepared a value-in-use by us-ing the expected cash flow method. Together with our valuation experts, we assessed the key assumptions made in respective scenarios on the recovery of the business to the pre-pandemic level, including growth rates and anticipated profit improvements. Furthermore, with assistance of our valuation experts, we evaluated the methodology applied in man-agement’s calculation of the discount rate. We compared the discount rate used by management to our inde-pendently calculated discount rate and found it to be within an accept-able range.Our procedures also included the sensitivity of the assumptions made in determining value in use by using the expected cash flow method.We compared the growth rates to the management board’s proven track record of improving performance by leveraging economies of scale and marketing. In relation to the annual goodwill impairment test, we especially focused our audit effort on the segments ‘Other Europe’ and ‘Americas and Asia’, in which some countries have either shown impairment charges, or were subject to global economic challenges due to COVID-19, and/or had lim-ited headroom in prior year(s).We evaluated and challenged management’s most sensitive cash flow assumptions, including but not limited to the scenarios, the growth rates and the COVID-19 implications to the business and compared them to long-term and strategic plans approved by the supervisory board. Also, we assessed the reasonableness of management’s valuation mod-els used and verified the mathematical accuracy.We involved valuation experts to evaluate the discount rates applied for each group of cash-generating units. Based on our procedures, we consider management’s key assumptions to be sufficiently supported by available evidence. In addition, we have evaluated the adequacy of the related disclosures.Key audit mattersKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the supervisory board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters identified by our audit and that we discussed. In this section, we described the key audit matters and included a summary of the audit procedures we performed on those matters.We addressed the key audit matters in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon. We do not provide separate opinions on these matters or on specific elements of the financial state-ments. Any comment or observation we made on the results of our procedures should be read in this context.\\\\x0cReport on the other information included in the annual reportIn addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report contains other information that consists of:• the management board report which includes the sections ‘GrandVision by the numbers’,  ‘Vision, mission, strategy’, ‘Our customer journey’, ‘GrandVision at a glance’, ‘A message from our CEO’, ‘Business and strategy’, ‘Our progress in 2020’, ‘Cor-porate governance (including remuneration report)’, ‘Shareholder information’ and ‘Other information’;• the other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code;Based on the procedures performed as set out below, we conclude that the other information:• is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements;• contains the information that is required by Part 9 of Book 2 and the sections 2:135b and 2:145 subsection 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained in our audit of the finan-cial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By performing our procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 and sec-tion 2:135b subsection 7 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of such proce-dures was substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements. The management board is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the management board’s report and the other information in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 and the sections 2:135b and 2:145 subsection 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.Report on other legal and regulatory requirementsOur appointmentWe were appointed as auditors of GrandVision N.V. on 14 October 2014 by the supervisory board following the passing of a resolution by the shareholders at the annual meeting held on 14 October 2014. Our appointment has been renewed annually by shareholders representing a total period of uninterrupted engagement appointment of 6 years.No prohibited non-audit servicesTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the European Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities.Services renderedThe services, in addition to the audit, that we have provided to the Company and its controlled entities, for the period to which our statutory audit relates, are disclosed in note 29 to the Consolidated financial statements.Responsibilities for the financial statements and the auditResponsibilities of the management board and the supervisory board for the financial statementsThe management board is responsible for:• the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; and for• such internal control as the management board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial state-ments that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\\\\x0cAs part of the preparation of the financial statements, the management board is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the management board should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the management board either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The management board should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statementsOur responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropri-ate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute level of assurance, which makes it possible that we may not detect all material misstatements. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified mis-statements on our opinion.A more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out in the appendix to our report.Amsterdam, 25 February 2021PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V.S. Laurie de Hernandez RA\\\\x0cAppendix to our auditor’s report on the financial statements 2020 of GrandVision N.V. In addition to what is included in our auditor’s report, we have further set out in this appendix our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves.The auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statementsWe have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit consisted, among other things of the following:• Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control.• Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appro-priate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.• Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management board.• Concluding on the appropriateness of the management board’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.• Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.Considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the Group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the Group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary.We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect, we also issue an additional report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor’s report.We provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.From the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.\\\\x0c\\\\x0cTransparency appendix\\\\n\\\\nOrganization of GrandVision CSR\\\\n\\\\nWe  believe  in  integrating  Corporate  Responsibility  and\\\\nSustainability  (CSR)  into  our  daily  processes.

\\\\n\\\\x0cMateriality and stakeholder\\\\ncommunication\\\\n\\\\nthe  public \\\\n\\\\nIn this report, we present our performance in relation to\\\\nour  goal  to  integrate  ESG  considerations  into  our\\\\nbusiness model and strategy. This goal, and therefore the\\\\ncontent  of  this  report,  are  based  on  both  an  internal\\\\nvalue chain analysis and on ongoing communication with\\\\nrelevant  stakeholders.  Our  most  relevant  stakeholders\\\\nare  our  employees,  customers,  suppliers,  investors  and\\\\nshareholders, \\\\nregulatory\\\\nauthorities, and broader society and communities where\\\\nwe  are  present.  These  stakeholders  were  selected\\\\nbecause we have a direct influence on their interests. To\\\\nenhance our awareness of the world around us and our\\\\nimpact on it, and to narrow down the focus of the report,\\\\nwe  created  a  materiality  analysis  in  late  2018.  The  next\\\\nupdate  is  expected  in  2021.  This  presents  the  most\\\\nrelevant topics that GrandVision has an impact on to our\\\\nstakeholders.  The  assessment  was  approved  by  the\\\\nManagement Board and consisted of three steps.\\\\n\\\\nsector  and \\\\n\\\\nStep 1. Determine relevant topics\\\\n\\\\nGrandVision  has  identified  a  shortlist  of  relevant  topics\\\\nbased on internal (strategy and risk related) and external\\\\n\\\\n(context related) developments. Relevant topics are those\\\\nwith which GrandVision has or can have an impact, inside\\\\nthe organization and in the value chain or society. During\\\\nan  internal  consultation,  the  Head  of  CSR  validated  the\\\\nupdated shortlist and where relevant, topics were further\\\\ndefined and missing topics were added.\\\\n\\\\nStep 2. Determine reporting priority\\\\n\\\\ntopics  from \\\\n\\\\nThe topics determined as relevant are assessed in terms\\\\nof  their  influence  on  GrandVision\\\\\\'s  ability  to  impact\\\\nsociety  and  influence  stakeholders’  decisions.  To  this\\\\nend,  we  carried  out  several  consultations.  To  prioritize\\\\nthe  stakeholders\\\\\\'  perspectives,  a\\\\nthe \\\\nstakeholder consultation was performed in 2018 through\\\\nan  online  survey, \\\\nimportant\\\\nstakeholder  groups:  employees,  investors,  customers,\\\\nsuppliers and analysts. These stakeholders were selected\\\\nbecause  GrandVision  directly  influences  their  interests.\\\\nAn internal consultation was held with the Management\\\\nBoard  to  adjust  the  prioritization  of  topics  from\\\\nGrandVision’s  perspective.  The  outcome  is  presented  in\\\\nthe materiality matrix below.\\\\n\\\\nincluding  our  most \\\\n\\\\n199\\\\n\\\\nO\\\\nT\\\\nH\\\\nE\\\\nR\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nF\\\\nO\\\\nR\\\\nM\\\\nA\\\\nT\\\\nI\\\\nO\\\\nN\\\\n\\\\nThe combination of the horizontal axis, which represents\\\\nthe impact that GrandVision can make on the topic, and\\\\nthe  vertical  axis,  which  represents  priorities  from\\\\nstakeholders\\\\\\' perspectives, helps us determine the most\\\\nmaterial  topics.
